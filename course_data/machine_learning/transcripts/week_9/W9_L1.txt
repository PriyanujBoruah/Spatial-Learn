Module 1: Introduction to Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ðŸ§ 
This module introduces the Multilayer Perceptron, a fundamental neural network model, and explains how to implement it for both classification and regression tasks in scikit-learn.

What is an MLP?: A Multilayer Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a non-linear function by training on a dataset. It is inspired by the structure of the human brain and consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. This layered structure allows the MLP to learn complex patterns that linear models cannot.

MLP for Classification and Regression: Scikit-learn provides two main implementations:

MLPClassifier: This is used for classification tasks. It supports multi-class classification by using a Softmax function in the output layer, which converts the network's raw outputs into probabilities for each class. It can also handle multi-label classification.

MLPRegressor: This is used for regression tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous value. It uses a linear activation function in the output layer and optimizes the squared error loss function. It also supports multi-output regression.

Basic Implementation: The implementation in scikit-learn is straightforward. You instantiate the model, fit it to the training data, and then use it to make predictions.

Python

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# 1. Instantiate the classifier
mlp_clf = MLPClassifier()

# 2. Fit the model to the training data
mlp_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Make predictions
predictions = mlp_clf.predict(X_test)

# For classification, you can also get probability estimates
probabilities = mlp_clf.predict_proba(X_test)
