Module 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning üßê
This module introduces the core concepts of unsupervised learning, contrasting it with supervised learning and highlighting its main applications and categories.

Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, where each data point has a known output or target. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data.

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns or structure on its own. There is no "correct" answer to learn from.

Applications of Unsupervised Learning:

Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior to create targeted marketing campaigns.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual data points that do not conform to expected patterns, which can be useful for fraud detection or identifying defective products.

Data Compression: Reducing the dimensionality of data to save storage space and speed up computations, as seen with PCA.

Topic Modeling: Discovering the main topics present in a collection of text documents.

Main Categories of Unsupervised Learning:

Clustering: The task of dividing the data into groups (clusters) such that data points in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

Dimensionality Reduction: The process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.
