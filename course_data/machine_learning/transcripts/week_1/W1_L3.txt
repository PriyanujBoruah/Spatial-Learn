Module 3: Data Loading and Datasets in Sklearn
This module focuses on the various ways to load and generate data using Scikit-Learn.

Dataset Loaders: These are used to load small, toy datasets that are included with the sklearn library. These datasets are useful for learning and experimenting with different algorithms. Examples include load_iris, load_diabetes, and load_digits. Both loaders and fetchers return a "Bunch" object, which is a dictionary-like object containing the data and target arrays, as well as other metadata.

Dataset Fetchers: These are used to download and load larger, real-world datasets from the internet. They are useful for working on more realistic machine learning problems. Examples include fetch_olivetti_faces, fetch_20newsgroups, and fetch_california_housing.

Dataset Generators: These are used to create synthetic datasets with specific characteristics. This is useful for testing algorithms under controlled conditions and for understanding how they behave with different types of data distributions. Examples include make_regression for regression tasks, make_blobs and make_classification for classification tasks, and make_multilabel_classification for multi-label problems.

Loading External Libraries: Sklearn also provides tools for loading data from external sources and in various formats. For example, fetch_openml can fetch datasets from the OpenML.org repository, and other libraries like pandas and scipy can be used to load data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and other common formats.
