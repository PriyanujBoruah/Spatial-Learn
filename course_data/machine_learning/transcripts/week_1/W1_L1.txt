Module 1: The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle
This module introduces the eight fundamental steps of an end-to-end machine learning project, providing a roadmap for tackling machine learning problems.

Step 1: Look at the Big Picture: This initial step involves understanding the business objective, framing the problem (e.g., as a classification or regression task), and selecting appropriate performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, or Precision/Recall for classification). It is crucial to list and verify all assumptions with stakeholders before proceeding.

Step 2: Get the Data: In this step, you'll identify and gather the data needed for the project. This can involve querying databases, accessing APIs, or downloading files. Once the data is obtained, it's important to explore its structure, features, and statistical properties.

Step 3: Data Visualization: Visualizing the data helps in gaining insights into the relationships between features and the target variable. Techniques such as scatter plots and heatmaps of correlation matrices can reveal important patterns and inform feature engineering and model selection.

Step 4: Prepare Data for ML Algorithm: This step, also known as data preprocessing, involves cleaning the data (e.g., handling missing values), transforming categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding), and scaling numerical features to a common range.

Step 5: Select and Train ML Model: With the data prepared, the next step is to choose and train a machine learning model. This could be a simple linear regression model or a more complex model like a decision tree or a random forest.

Step 6: Fine-tune Your Model: To improve the performance of the model, you can fine-tune its hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. These methods systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Step 7: Present Your Solution: Before deploying the model, it's important to present the solution to stakeholders. This includes documenting the process, visualizing the results, and clearly communicating the model's limitations and assumptions.

Step 8: Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System: The final step is to deploy the model into a production environment. This involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, writing test cases, and continuously monitoring the model's performance. It's also crucial to have a plan for retraining the model with fresh data to maintain its accuracy over time.
