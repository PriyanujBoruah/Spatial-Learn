Module 3: The Art of Hyperparameter Tuning ðŸŽ¨
This module provides a comprehensive guide to hyperparameter tuning, a crucial step for optimizing any machine learning model.

Parameters vs. Hyperparameters:

Parameters: These are learned from the data during the training process (e.g., the coefficients of a linear regression model).

Hyperparameters: These are set before the training process begins and control the learning process itself (e.g., the alpha in Ridge regression or the degree in polynomial regression).

The Search for Optimal Hyperparameters: The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the combination of hyperparameter values that results in the best model performance on unseen data. This is typically done by evaluating different combinations on a validation set.

GridSearchCV:

Concept: GridSearchCV performs an exhaustive search over a specified grid of hyperparameter values. It trains and evaluates a model for every possible combination using cross-validation.

Implementation: You provide an estimator, a parameter grid (a dictionary where keys are hyperparameters and values are lists of values to try), and a cross-validation strategy. GridSearchCV then finds and retrains the best model on the full training set.

RandomizedSearchCV:

Concept: When the hyperparameter space is large, GridSearchCV can be too slow. RandomizedSearchCV is a more efficient alternative that samples a fixed number of parameter combinations from specified statistical distributions.

Advantages: This approach allows you to control your computational budget (via the n_iter parameter) and is often more effective at finding good hyperparameter combinations than a grid search.

The HPT Workflow:

Split Data: Divide your data into training, validation, and test sets.

Search: For each combination of hyperparameters, train a model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set.

Select Best Model: Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set.

Retrain: Retrain the best model on the combined training and validation sets.

Final Evaluation: Evaluate the final model on the test set to get an unbiased estimate of its generalization performance.
