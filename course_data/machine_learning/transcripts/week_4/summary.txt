Week 4 builds upon the foundational concepts of linear regression by introducing techniques to model non-linear relationships and to prevent overfitting. The week is centered around Polynomial Regression, Regularization (Ridge and Lasso), and the critical process of Hyperparameter Tuning.

The key takeaways from the fourth week are:

Polynomial Regression: This technique extends linear regression to capture non-linear trends in the data. It works by creating new features that are powers of the original features (e.g., x², x³) and their interaction terms (e.g., x₁ * x₂). This transformation allows a linear model to fit a non-linear function. The implementation is often done using scikit-learn's PolynomialFeatures transformer within a Pipeline to ensure a smooth workflow.

Regularization: This is a set of techniques used to combat overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function, which discourages overly complex models. The two main types of regularization covered are:

Ridge Regression (L2 Penalty): This method adds a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This has the effect of shrinking the coefficients towards zero, but not exactly to zero.

Lasso Regression (L1 Penalty): This method adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. A key advantage of Lasso is that it can force some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating less important features.

Elastic Net: A combination of both L1 and L2 penalties, offering a balance between the two.

Hyperparameter Tuning: This is the process of finding the optimal values for a model's hyperparameters, which are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set prior to training. The week covers two primary strategies for this:

GridSearchCV: This method performs an exhaustive search over a specified grid of hyperparameter values, evaluating each combination using cross-validation. It is thorough but can be computationally expensive.

RandomizedSearchCV: This method samples a fixed number of parameter settings from specified statistical distributions. It is often more efficient than GridSearchCV, especially when the hyperparameter space is large.

Model-Specific Cross-Validation: For certain models, scikit-learn offers more efficient, built-in cross-validation estimators for tuning specific hyperparameters. For regularization, these include RidgeCV, LassoCV, and ElasticNetCV, which efficiently search for the best regularization strength (alpha).
