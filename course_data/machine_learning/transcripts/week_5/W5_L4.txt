Module 4: Evaluating Classifier Performance âœ…
This module provides you with the essential tools and techniques for evaluating the performance of your classification models, ensuring that your assessments are robust and meaningful.

Stratified Cross-Validation: When dealing with classification problems, especially those with class imbalance, standard cross-validation can lead to folds that do not represent the overall class distribution. Stratified cross-validation iterators (StratifiedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold) ensure that each fold has the same proportion of each class as the original dataset, leading to more reliable performance estimates.

The Confusion Matrix: This is a fundamental tool for understanding a classifier's performance. It is a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

confusion_matrix: This function from sklearn.metrics computes the confusion matrix.

ConfusionMatrixDisplay: This provides a convenient way to visualize the matrix, either from an estimator or from predictions.

Key Classification Metrics:

accuracy_score: The proportion of correctly classified samples. Can be misleading on imbalanced datasets.

precision_score: The ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative.

recall_score: The ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

f1_score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both.

classification_report: This function builds a text report showing the main classification metrics for each class.

Extending Binary Metrics to Multi-Learning Problems: When evaluating multiclass or multilabel problems, you can average the binary metrics across all classes using the average parameter:

'macro': Calculates the mean of the binary metrics, giving equal weight to each class.

'weighted': Computes the average of binary metrics, weighted by the number of true instances for each class.

'micro': Gives each sample-class pair an equal contribution to the overall metric.
