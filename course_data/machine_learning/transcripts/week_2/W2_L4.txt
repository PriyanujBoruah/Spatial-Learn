Module 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction ðŸ“‰
This module addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data by introducing techniques to select the most relevant features or to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

Feature Selection: This is the process of selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the prediction task. This can improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and make the model more interpretable.

Filter-Based Methods: These methods use statistical tests to score and select features. They are generally fast and model-agnostic.

VarianceThreshold: This is a simple method that removes features with low variance.

SelectKBest and SelectPercentile: These select the k best features or the top percentile of features based on a scoring function like chi-squared or mutual information.

Wrapper-Based Methods: These methods use a machine learning model to evaluate different subsets of features. They are more computationally expensive but can often lead to better results.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This method recursively fits a model and removes the least important feature until the desired number of features is reached.

SelectFromModel: This method selects features based on their importance as determined by a trained model.

Sequential Feature Selector (SFS): This method greedily selects or deselects features one by one to find the best subset.

Dimensionality Reduction: These techniques transform the data into a lower-dimensional space while trying to preserve as much of the original information as possible.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that projects the data onto a set of orthogonal axes called principal components. The first principal component captures the most variance in the data, and subsequent components capture decreasing amounts of variance. By keeping only the first few principal components, you can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of its variance.
