Module 4: Practical Implementation in Scikit-Learn ðŸ’»
This module provides a practical guide to using Naive Bayes classifiers in Scikit-Learn, from training to prediction.

General Workflow: The implementation of all Naive Bayes classifiers in Scikit-Learn follows a consistent pattern, making them easy to use.

Import: First, you import the desired classifier from sklearn.naive_bayes.

Instantiate: You then create an instance of the classifier.

Fit: You train the model using the fit() method, passing the training features (X_train) and labels (y_train).

Predict: You can then make predictions on new data using the predict() method.

Example Implementation:

Python

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assume X and y are your features and labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# 1. Instantiate the model
gnb = GaussianNB()

# 2. Fit the model
gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Make predictions
y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)

# 4. Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
When to Use Naive Bayes:

Quick Baseline: Due to its speed and simplicity, Naive Bayes is an excellent choice for establishing a baseline performance metric for your classification task.

Text Classification: Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes are particularly effective for text-related tasks like spam detection and document categorization.

Large Datasets: The algorithm's efficiency makes it suitable for very large datasets where more complex models might be too slow to train.
