Module 2: Gaussian and Multinomial Naive Bayes ðŸ“Š
This module explores two of the most commonly used Naive Bayes classifiers, each designed for different types of numerical data.

Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):

Use Case: This classifier is used when your features are continuous and are assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. For each class, the algorithm estimates the mean and standard deviation of each feature from the training data.

How it Works: When making a prediction for a new data point, GaussianNB calculates the probability of that data point belonging to each class by plugging its feature values into the Gaussian probability density function for each class.

Implementation:

Python

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
gnb = GaussianNB()
gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB):

Use Case: This classifier is designed for features that represent discrete counts. Its primary application is in text classification, where the features can be the frequency of words in a document (word counts).

How it Works: It models the probability of observing a certain count for each feature given a class, based on the multinomial distribution.

Implementation:

Python

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
mnb = MultinomialNB()
mnb.fit(X_train, y_train)
