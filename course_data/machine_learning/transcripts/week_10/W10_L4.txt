Module 4: External Clustering Evaluation Metrics and Practical Considerations üìù
This module covers external evaluation metrics, which are used when you have access to the ground truth class labels, and provides practical advice for applying clustering in real-world scenarios.

External Evaluation (When Ground Truth is Known): While clustering is an unsupervised task, having ground truth labels can be useful for benchmarking algorithms or for understanding how well the clusters align with known categories in the data.

Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): This metric measures the similarity between the true and predicted clusterings, adjusted for chance. A score of 1 indicates a perfect match, while a score close to 0 indicates a random assignment.

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI): This metric measures the mutual information between the true and predicted clusterings, normalized to a [0, 1] range. A higher value indicates better agreement between the two clusterings.

Practical Considerations:

Choosing the Number of Clusters (k): For algorithms like K-Means and GMM, choosing the optimal number of clusters is a critical step. The "elbow method" (plotting inertia against the number of clusters) and using internal evaluation metrics like the Silhouette Score can help guide this decision.

Feature Scaling: Just like with supervised learning, it is crucial to scale your features before applying clustering algorithms that are distance-based (which is most of them).

Interpreting Clusters: After finding clusters, the final step is to interpret them by examining the characteristics of the data points within each cluster. This often involves working with domain experts to understand what the discovered patterns mean in a real-world context.
