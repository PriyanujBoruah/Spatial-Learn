Module 2: Implementing KNeighborsClassifier üßë‚Äçüíª
This module provides a deep dive into the practical implementation and key hyperparameters of the KNeighborsClassifier, the most common KNN algorithm.

Basic Implementation: Using KNeighborsClassifier in Scikit-Learn is straightforward. You first instantiate the classifier and then fit it to your training data.

Python

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Instantiate the classifier
kneighbor_classifier = KNeighborsClassifier()

# Fit the model to the training data
kneighbor_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
Key Hyperparameters:

n_neighbors: This is the 'k' in KNN and specifies the number of nearest neighbors to use for classification. The default value is 5. Choosing the right 'k' is a critical step in building an effective KNN model.

weights: This parameter determines how the votes of the neighbors are weighted.

'uniform' (Default): All neighbors in the neighborhood are given an equal vote.

'distance': Neighbors are weighted by the inverse of their distance from the new point. This means that closer neighbors will have a greater influence on the final prediction than neighbors that are further away.

Custom Function: You can also provide your own callable function that takes an array of distances and returns an array of weights.
