Module 3: Algorithms for Finding Neighbors ðŸŒ³
This module explores the different algorithms that can be used to efficiently find the nearest neighbors, a critical component of the KNN model's performance.

The algorithm Parameter: This parameter specifies the algorithm to be used to compute the nearest neighbors.

'brute': This uses a brute-force search, calculating the distance between the new point and every single point in the training data. While simple, it can be very slow for large datasets.

'kd_tree': This uses a data structure called a KD-tree to organize the training data, which can significantly speed up the search for nearest neighbors.

'ball_tree': This uses a Ball Tree data structure, which is effective for data in high-dimensional spaces.

'auto' (Default): This setting will automatically attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm based on the data passed to the fit method.

Parameters for Tree-Based Algorithms: When using 'ball_tree' or 'kd_tree', you can further tune their performance with these parameters:

leaf_size: This determines the number of points at which the algorithm switches from building the tree to a brute-force search. The default is 30. This can affect the speed of both the tree's construction and the query time, as well as the memory required to store the tree.

metric: This specifies the distance metric to use for the tree. The default is 'minkowski'. Other common choices include 'euclidean' and 'manhattan'.

p: This is the power parameter for the Minkowski metric. A value of p=2 (the default) corresponds to the Euclidean distance, while p=1 corresponds to the Manhattan distance.
