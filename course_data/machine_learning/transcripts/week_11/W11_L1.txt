Module 1: Introduction to Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ðŸ§ 
This module introduces the Multilayer Perceptron, a fundamental type of neural network, and explains its implementation in Scikit-Learn for both classification and regression.

What is an MLP?: A Multilayer Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a non-linear function by training on a dataset. It is composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. This layered architecture allows the MLP to learn more complex patterns than linear models.

MLP for Classification and Regression: Scikit-Learn provides two primary classes for implementing MLPs:

MLPClassifier: This is used for classification problems. It supports multi-class classification by using a Softmax function in the output layer, which provides probability estimates for each class. It can also be used for multi-label classification.

MLPRegressor: This is used for regression problems where the goal is to predict a continuous value. It uses a linear activation function in the output layer and optimizes the squared error loss function. It also supports multi-output regression.

Basic Implementation: The implementation process is consistent with other Scikit-Learn models. You first instantiate the model, then fit it to your training data.

Python

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# 1. Instantiate the classifier
mlp_clf = MLPClassifier()

# 2. Fit the model to the training data
mlp_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Make predictions
predictions = mlp_clf.predict(X_test)

# You can also get probability estimates for classification
probabilities = mlp_clf.predict_proba(X_test)
