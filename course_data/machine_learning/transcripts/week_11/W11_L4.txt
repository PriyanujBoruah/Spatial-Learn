Module 4: Model Inspection and Practical Considerations ðŸ”¬
This final module covers how to look inside a trained MLP to understand what it has learned and provides practical tips for using these models effectively.

Inspecting the Trained Model: After the model has been trained, you can access its learned parameters to gain insights into its internal workings.

coefs_ (Weight Matrices): This attribute is a list of weight matrices for each layer. The element at index i in the list is the weight matrix for the connection between layer i and layer i+1.

intercepts_ (Bias Vectors): This attribute is a list of bias vectors. The element at index i is the bias vector for the neurons in layer i+1.

Practical Considerations:

Feature Scaling: MLPs are sensitive to feature scaling, so it is highly recommended to scale your data before training. StandardScaler is a common choice.

Complexity and Training Time: MLPs can have many hyperparameters, and finding the best combination can be a computationally intensive process.

Interpretability: Unlike simpler models like linear regression or decision trees, MLPs are often considered "black box" models, as it can be challenging to interpret exactly how they are making their predictions.
