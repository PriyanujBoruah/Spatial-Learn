This was our Excel. This was our Excel. This was our data. This was our data. The first thing we saw was the correlation coefficients. And we saw that the correlation between the explanatory variable and the response variable is fairly strong. So, we went ahead. We said this looks like a good set of explanatory variables to have. We can calculate the log expression log exploration is nothing but beta naught plus beta 1 x1 plus beta 2 x2 plus beta 3 x3 plus beta 4 x4, which came from here. Then we calculated the odds or the essentially exponential of the log of odds. And then we calculated the probability, probability was exponential plus 1 exponential divided by 1 plus x explanation, which is this. So, this is the predicted value of probability of the student getting a job. From here we calculated that the probability that the estimate will be correct the model estimate will be correct model prediction will be correct. And we saw that this probability is 0.975 however, this probability is 0.995 even though the probability of day 0 job was only 0.04 and that was because here the y is equal to actually 0 here the y was 1 then we took a log of these probabilities. And this was our objective to maximize this log summation which was written here. Sum of all the log probabilities and we use this as our objective function told Excel that Excel should maximize this value by adjusting these values. So, these are the estimated values of betas which maximize the log likelihood we maximize the log likelihood. Now, let us go back and discuss some logic. We have seen the Excel sheet now, let us come back to logic. So, we have tried to explain the calculations in the Excel sheet in the Excel sheet itself. Let us let us put some logic behind all this. So, first we saw that the Excel sheet calculates the probability that the student will be placed. That was the probability of y equal to 1 and that was the forecasted probability. This is the probability that the model predicts. From this probability, we actually want to see whether the student will get placed or not our response variable, remember it is only binary, we do not want the probability of y to be equal to 1, we actually want the value of y. So, we do not want the probability of y to be equal to 1, we want the value of y we do not want this we want this. So, how do we do that? One simple way to do that is to define the threshold value of the probability. Let us define a threshold problem. So, let us say that if the forecasted probability of y is equal to 1 is above a certain threshold, we will then code y is equal to 1. And if the probability of y is equal to 1 is less than that threshold, then we will code y is equal to 0. If the forecast reads probabilities below that threshold, then we can say that the y is equal to 0. And therefore, the student will predict that the student will not get placed. The model is predicting that the student will not get placed. If the probability is below certain thresholds. So, let us see that in Excel again. So, this is what I mean. So, here we have defined that cut-off, I have defined the cut-off to be 0.5. So, where am I using the cut-off, I am using the cut-off on this probability. Probability that the student will get a job on day 0. So, if this property is more than the threshold. So, 0.97 is more than 0.5, I will classify as y as 1. So, remember this is the predicted value of y, this is predicted y, this is predicted by the probability of y is equal to 1 calculated from the model is 0.975. This 0.975 is more than 0.5, and therefore I will code y is equal to 1, this is my prediction for this student. Similarly, my prediction for the second student, I will look at the probability of day 1 job, just to tell you the expression, I am looking at this probability checking whether this probability is more than threshold and defining y to be 1 or 0, as I had mentioned in the slide. So, essentially, this is my predicted value of y and this is my actual value of y, this is my actual value of y. So, these are the actual values. And these are the predicted values, these are the predicted values. So, my prediction is right. My prediction is right. My prediction is right. My prediction is right. My prediction is right, right, right, right. This is the first instance where my prediction from the model seems to be incorrect. My prediction for the model of my prediction from the model for this particular student, said that the student will not get placed y will be 0. Now, why did we say y was 0 because I calculated the probability of a student getting a job on day 0, that probability turned out to be 0.466 predicted from the model. That 0.466 turned out to be lesser than my threshold, my threshold was at 0.5. And then I said since the calculated or the estimated probability is less than the threshold, I will codify my y to be 0. It turns out that the actual value of y was 1. So, this is the first instance that my model has predicted incorrectly, incorrectly. So, once again, now, let us not focus on that. These are the actual values of y observed values of y, these are the predicted values of y. Now, I have gotten my model to tell me clearly apples and oranges, these properties do not help me much. These probabilities do not help me that much, I need this threshold. So, I hope things are okay. So far, I hope things are okay so far. So, I used day 0 probability and defined the threshold over that. And then we said any probability above the threshold, we will codify y to be 1 any probability lesser than threshold C, any probability lesser than threshold, this 0.37 is lesser than 0.05. So, we will codify y to be 0. And we did that for all the data points. Sometimes our model is going to be right, sometimes our model is going to be wrong. Look at all these instances, look at all this. Here we already saw this here look at this, this instance, look at this instance. This student has a good MBA CGPA 7.89 decent experience, decent UG CGPA extracurricular activities are good. Actually, the student did get placed on day 0. My model predicted that the student will not get placed on day 0. So, once again, I am wrong. The model is wrong. Why is the model wrong because the model calculated the probability that a student will get placed 0.23 was the probability 0.23 turned out to be lesser than the threshold 0.23 turned out to be lesser than the threshold and therefore, we codified y to be equal to 0. Similarly, the probability that the student will get placed was estimated to be 0.274 by the model 0.274 was much lesser, lesser than the threshold and therefore y was codified to be 0. Obviously, sometimes the model will get it right. Sometimes the model will not get it right. The question then is right now my definition of this threshold probability seems to be arbitrary. How did I decide on 0.5? Why did I say that? Anytime this probability, anytime this probability is more than 0.5. I will codify y to be 1 and any time this probability is less than 0.5, I will qualify the y to be 0. How do I decide on this 0.5? There has to be some solid mathematical or statistical logic for this. Let us do that in the next session.
