Welcome students to this new session. Today we are going to answer a very interesting question. The question is right there on the slide. So, we are talking about a B School. And in particular, we are talking about the placement process in a B School, for any B school by the school, I mean a business school, a management school or management department. For any B school placement process is very important by placement process this is a typical term that is used placement process. Placement process is essentially the recruitment process for MBA students. Where the institute the school or the department facilitates various recruiters coming to campus and providing job opportunities to the graduating batch of the MBA students. So, the question that we are asking is will a student get a job from this placement process? So, this is the scenario that we are answering statistically speaking, what we are trying to discuss in this session is trying to predict categorical outcomes. So, the way we have phrased the question, clearly the answer is yes or no will a student get placed? Probably the student will or perhaps the student will not. So, essentially, we are asking a very categorical question and therefore answer is yes, no. But the technique that we are going to discuss in this session is going to be applicable to all categorical outcomes need not necessarily be only yes, no kind of an answer. So, but we will discuss this as we go along. So, let us first discuss the placement process. So, as I said, placement process is a recruitment process for the graduating students where they have opportunities to sit for interviews and perhaps get themselves a job. So, obviously the job opportunities are to be chosen from the choices that are provided. So, probably the student may not get the dream job but she may hope to get the best possible job of her choice from the choices that are provided. So, sometimes the recruiters do not come to a particular campus, and therefore that job opportunity is not even available. But the idea is, can I pick up a job for myself? Obviously, we want or we would expect this recruitment process or this placement process to be dependent on various student attributes. We would like to think that academic performance matters. The prior experience of the student's before joining the MBA program probably would matter. The kind of internships that the students have done in their MBA curriculum, probably summer internship, winter internship at various organizations on various projects, probably should have some bearing on the outcome of the placement process. And that is what we are going to do, we are going to take these attributes and see whether they actually help us forecast the outcome of the placement process. And as I said, the response variable in our question is the final question. Would the student pick up a job? And that we said is binary student either gets a job or she does not get a job. However, as I said earlier, the statistical method that we are going to discuss in this session is applicable to a scenario where the outcome is not only binary but the outcome could have several categorical values. So, what I am saying is here the outcome variable has only two possible categories, yes and no. But the technique that we are discussing is equally applicable to outcomes, which have more than two categories. But the example that we are going to discuss in this session, obviously has a response variable which is binary. So, let us dig in further on this question of placement. So, we have already identified the student attributes. So, let us describe them sequentially. So, let us consider these variables that can help us sort of explain the probability of students getting placed as I said the academic performance should matter. So, let us pick up those variables. So, let us say that the academic performance during the undergrad degree remember we are talking about the placement of opportunities for the MBA students which is a postgraduate degree. So, everybody who comes to the MBA program has necessarily completed an undergraduate degree and the academic performance in that undergraduate degree probably would also have some bearing on the placement probability of the student during the MBA program. Academic performance in the undergraduate matter the academic performance during the MBA should matter right, obviously. As we said earlier, the industry experience prior to joining the MBA program should matter. So, there are a significant proportion of the students who come to the MBA program with some work experience. So, after their undergraduate degree, they probably work in some organization for a couple of years, three years and then join the MBA program and what kind of experience they had prior to joining the MBA program probably would also have a bearing on the placement chances. Also matters one more variable that will also matter is the participation in co-curricular and extracurricular activities that helps in overall development of a student. So, for various organizations, various Institutes have co-curricular activities, debates, debate club, some Institutes have co-curricular activities in the sense that there is a finance club there is a marketing club, there is an operations club. So, people who are interested in finance vertical of the management studies meet every so often get the industry person and interact with them make presentations. So, those are essentially co-curricular activities and extracurricular activities are essentially the student festivals that many students participate in. Lastly, as so, let us say that all these variables are our score on a scale of ten. So, that we are equal on the scale values and as I said earlier other response variable is whether the student got any placement or not therefore a binary variable. So, let us look at this data in an Excel sheet. But before we go look at the data, let me put up a disclaimer, this is a pure synthetic data. This data is not from any academic Institute, the example that we are discussing is only for the purpose of explaining the concept. So, I request you not to associate this data set with any management program anywhere in this country or anywhere in this world. This is only synthetic data, let me be very clear on this disclaimer. Let us not make any judgment on the business school or any business school using this data. This data is only for illustrative purposes. So, let us look at the Excel sheet as I said, So, this is the data let me zoom it in. So, this is the student placement data and we I think has student data for twenty seven students from a particular batch twenty seven students, So, as I said the MBA CGPA is available, the UG CGPA is available their experience is also available. Right now, the values are as I said, anywhere between zero to ten. So, every B School has a ranking method for the experience. And let us say that they have already ranked the students or the rate or they have already provided the rating for a student on a scale of ten they B School have probably has already done a rating on a scale of ten for students on their extracurricular activity participation and this is the final outcome. Earlier in the slides, I had discussed only the placement result. Here I am going one step ahead, there is something called day zero placement. Does not matter what day zero placement is, or day one placement is day zero placement means the zero is day of placement. People who are picked up students who are picked up right on the first day of the recruitment process opening. Generally, it is believed that the best of the recruiters come very early, and therefore if the students are getting placed or if the students are getting job opportunities right on day zero, it is called day zero it is not called day one for whatever reason that is the terminology used. So, if they are able to pick up a job for themselves on day zero obviously, they are performing very well. So, these are the final outcomes for student one, student two, student three, student four. So, for example, student one has a CGPA, MBA CGPA of nine point one or UGC GPA of eight point one extracurricular activities this student has been fairly good eight point six and experience also for two point three. Whatever the rating is two point three. And the final outcome is the student actually got placed on day zero. Whereas, student number three, who has a CGPA of seven, so, lesser than the first student, eight UG GPA, which is again lesser than the first student, but the experience is much better. Experience is rated at three point nine against two point three. So, the experience is better, but the extracurricular activities are not so great only five point one three rating against eight point six ratings for student one. And unfortunately the student did not get placed on the day zero. So, this is the outcome. This is outcome variable. So, what is the first order of business any statistical method that we want to employ, what is the first order of business? The first order of business is essentially to code this output. So, let us since we are interested in student getting placed. Let us call anybody who has placed as one and anybody who does not get placed as zero let us do that. So, this is the coded output. So, this is the same data essentially the same data nothing has been changed in this portion. Nothing has been changed in this portion. However, the outcome variable now has been coded as one or zero point one when the student got placed and zero if the student did not get placed. I hope you have understood the data. So, essentially four variables are MBA CGPA, UG CGPA, experience and extra curricular activities. These are the student attributes we are hoping may explain the placement result. And the placement results are essentially one if the student got placed zero if the student did not get placed. Let us go back to PPT and define the set of variables mathematically. So, once again, once you have seen the Excel sheet, the disclaimer is this is synthetically generated data and it has it was not taken from any real life academic Institute. So, essentially what are we asking? We are asking what are we interested in we are interested in building a model that can help us predict the chance of a student in a placement process. So, for a student if we know the attribute values if we know the student's academic performance during UG program, student's academic performance during MBA program, student's extracurricular activities, student's prior internships, experiences, can we then forecast the whether the student will get placed or not. So, we essentially want to build that engine we want to build that statistical model. That is what we are interested in. We are trying to build a model that can help us predict the outcome of the placement process given the input data. So, let us define the variables let x one be the academic performance during MBA. Let x two be the industry experience prior to joining the MBA program, x three may be the academic performance during the undergraduate degree, and x four may be the participation in the co-curricular and extracurricular activities. So, these four are x variables and our outcome variable let us call that y. So, let us say that y is equal to one if the student actually gets placed and zero otherwise. So, now, we have identified the variables. So, we have defined the variables mathematically, x one, x two, x three, x four and y. Let us jump into it. So, this is where once we have understood the data. We can wrap up this session and continue with the next session where we actually start working with the data.
