Okay, so, we were looking at how to evaluate our model and we saw these three performance indicators, performance measures, accuracy, recall and precision and we had a detailed discussion about that. Now, what we are going to do is we are going to interpret the betas. We are going to interpret the regression coefficients. Remember, in MLR what was the interpretation of our regression coefficient? In MLR, what do I mean by regression coefficient? The betas, beta not, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta not is intercept. So, let's not worry about that, beta 1 x1, beta 2 x2, therefore, beta 1 is linked to first explanatory variable, beta 2 is linked with second explanatory variable. What was the interpretation of beta 1, beta 2 in MLR? Recall that. So, the interpretation of beta 1 was, keeping all the other explanatory variables fixed, 1 unit change in x1 changes y variable by how much. That is what is indicated by beta or beta 1. For logistic regression obviously the interpretation is going to be different. So, essentially in MLR the regression coefficients are the change in the response variable with a unit change in the corresponding explanatory variable keeping all the other explanatory variables constant. So, those were called partial slope. So, betas were called partial slopes. In the logistic regression the interpretation is different. It is similar but different because now we are talking about log of odds. Our response variable is not direct value of y, our response variable is log of odds. It is not linear. So, how do you interpret the betas in case of logistic regression? So, we say that 1 unit change in explanatory variable brings about beta change in the log of odds, not beta change in the value of y. Because here the value of y is only 0 and 1. So, we are going to say that 1 unit change 1 jump in CGPA in MBA programme from 7 to 8 or 8 to 9 brings about beta change in the log of odds. So, if the explanatory variable changes by 1 unit, the odds of y is equal to 1 increases by 10 to the power of beta, if we are using log to the power base of 10. If we take natural log, there is a typo here, if we take the natural log, the odds actually increase with a factor of e to the power of beta. So, for our example, the regression coefficient for the MBA CGPA was 3.27. beta 1 was 3.27. So, how do you interpret this 3.27? We say that 1 unit increase in CGPA of MBA student increases the odds of the student, odds not the probabilities, odds of the student. Getting placed increases by 26.31. Remember, this is a prediction on the odds of the probability, odds of success, not the probabilities themselves. The probability that a student will get placed also would have increased because the CGPA in MBA programme has increased. We saw the plot in the last session. If the probability, if the CGPA in MBA programme increases, the probability that the student will get placed also increases. But remember that we are not estimating or we are not interpreting in terms of probability. We are interpreting in the context of odds. So, we are saying 1 unit increase in CGPA increases the odds of student getting placed by 26.31. That is how you interpret the regression coefficients in a logistic regression setup. With that, let us end the session and obviously we are going to continue with an example of this in python and that should give you more insights. So, I am closing this session now.
