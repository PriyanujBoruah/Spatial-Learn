foreign [Music] on guessing a distribution this tutorial is going to be divided into three videos the first video the current one you are watching would focus on giving you an introduction to the price quiet goodness of the test the second and third video would be demonstrating this test in a tool which is python for us so what is the chi-squared goodness of a test this test is basically going to be used to see if the proposed distribution or the hypothesized distribution for the population is a good fit for the population or not so that is going to be the focus of this particular test and what is required for performing this test we require something known as the frequency table so the frequency table is going to consist of three columns the first one is going to be the bins right so these are going to be the ranges over which we are going to be capturing the value so those are the bins so let's say we have bins 1 up to K so we have K different bins and for each of these bins we need something known as The observed frequency observed frequency let's call this o1 up to ok so these are the values that we observed in a sample that is got from the population so how many observations in the sample fall in bin one how many observations in the sample fall in bin 2. how many observations in the sample fall in bin K so that is going to be the observed frequency the third column is going to be the expected frequency if this sample is indeed coming from a population then what is the expected number of outcomes E1 that is going to fall in bin one similarly how many observations should fall in bin 2 if this sample is really coming from the theorized population distribution so that is E2 and so on up to e k so this is going to be the frequency table which is going to be give hug which is going to be used for performing the chi-squared goodness of the test and thus for in your statistics course this table would have been given to you and you would perform the test so how would you perform the test you will compute the test statistic which is going to be the chi-squared statistic and this Chi is quite statistic is going to be computed as 1 minus E1 the whole squared by E1 4 2 minus E2 the whole squared by E2 so on and so forth up to okay minus E K the whole squared by e k right so the summation of these values summation I is equal to 1 to K o i minus e i the whole squared by e i this is going to be the test statistic that you are going to compute given this frequency table now once you have got a test statistic how would you conclude whether you are going to accept the null hypothesis or reject the null hypothesis that is going to be the end goal of any test correct so for that you can use two approaches the first approach is the p-value right so for this chi-square value that you have got you will compute the p-value you have not go into the computations since that is in your basic course but you will compute the p-value and if the p-value is lesser than your significance level which is your Alpha you would conclude by saying reject H naught so that is going to be your conclusion if your P value is lesser than the significance level Alpha that you are setting then you will reject the null hypothesis on the second technique this is let us say method one in method 2 you will come for this computed test statistics you will calculate a chi-squared tabulated value let's call this tabulated value at a degrees of freedom which is given as K minus P minus 1 I'll come to the b in a minute at a level of significance which is Alpha and your conclusion would be reject the null hypothesis if your chi-squared tabulated is lesser than your Chi Squared computing right so if your Chi square tabulated is lesser than this computed test statistic then you will reject the null hypothesis so that is going to be the final conclusion now what is this p this p is the number of parameters in the population distribution that you need to compute for a given test right so this P would vary from based on the distribution that you are assuming so let us say we are going to be looking at two distributions in our demonstration so I will give you the values for those two let's say you are telling the population follows a let's say a uniform distribution for a uniform distribution the two parameters that you will be Computing are the lower value and the upper volume which is a and b so in this case for a uniform distribution the p is equal to 2. whereas the second one which is the poisson distribution for a poisson distribution the only parameter that you need is Lambda right so everything else is got based on that Lambda so in that case p is going to be equal to 1 which is your Lambda in the uniform distribution is going to be a and b the lower value and the upper value so these number of parameters that you are going to compute will vary from distribution to distribution let us say we take a third one which we are not going to demonstrate but which is very common which is the normal so for normal distribution you need the MU and the sigma values or the sigma squared value variance the sigma the sigma square right so in this case the p is going to be equal to 2. so for every distribution that you are going to fit you must know the number of parameters that you need to compute for the distribution and since you are going to compute them using the sample so many degrees of freedom will be reduced from your uh chi Square test so your Chi Square test K minus P minus 1 would be K minus 2 minus 1 in the K when you are doing it for a poisson it will be K minus 1 minus 1 when you are doing it for a uh for a for a poisson distribution it will be K minus 2 minus one pardon me for a uniform distribution it will be K minus 1 minus 1 for a poisson distribution and K minus 2 minus 1 again for your normal distribution and K is going to be the number of bins that you use right so K is the number of bins p is the number of parameters that you are going to compute using the sample for the population and minus 1 is an additional degree of Freedom that you will be losing so this is the degrees of freedom d o yes so when you look at um getting the tabulated value so Chi Squared tabulated is obtained for a degrees of freedom and at a given significance level Alpha and if this tabulated value is lesser than your chi-squared computed value you would reject the nulls health if not you will not reject the null hypothesis so this is the initial introduction to the chi Square test that you have studied so far in your statistics course now comes the business perspective till this point is pure statistics right and however for all of this test to work you need this particular frequency table to be available for you however in actual business world you will not be having this frequency table you will only be having a data set and the data set usually would look like let's say The observed value let us say we are talking about the first distribution that we will be talking about is uniform right so in our tutorial so for that let us say we are measuring the length of scratch on a vehicle that is manufactured so you're going to manufacture a vehicle and during the manufacturing process let's say scratches happen and you are going to measure the lens of the scratch so the length of the scratch is going to be let's say in mm so what do you have you have an observed value which is going to be like 1.1 1.5 0.5 0.7 0.9 or 3.0 whatever right so these are going to be the values that you actually get and these values you must then convert them to a frequency table and then say whether these are following a uniform distribution or not so the objective of this entire tutorial is to show you how you given a data set like The observed values with your let's say a length of scratch in mm or number of defects let's say so on and so forth given that data set given a list of observed values how do you convert it into a frequency table and once you have converted it into a frequency table how would you identify ah how do you perform the Chi Squared goodness of fit test and whether accept original or do not whether you reject the null or do not reject the null so that is going to be the entire discussion in the remaining two videos of this particular tutorial we would stop here and in the next tutorial we would pick up fitting and distribution for a given data set which is going to be uniformly ah which is coming from a uniform population
