So, let me start the second session, welcoming back the audience to this visualization session. In the last session, we had focused on the three-step process of having a message is important. Once we have the message loud and clear the form of visualization becomes important and how do you design that form was what was discussed in the last session. Let us take examples of these three parts of the visualization process in this session. Starting with defining the message as we have said message is the most important starting point unless the message is not clear how are you going to design the visualization for the data. So, why do you think the message is important. So, again right now what is the purpose? you know we do not sit here and create graph charts for fun. we do it for a reason, now a simple example So, I and on the right what you see is a tabular this one where we have shown the number of people like various age buckets and the number of aids cases. So, now what is it that you want to show. Now my display will this one if I look at this, I can look at several things that messages that I might want to communicate with the same data. I might want to come back and say between 35 to 39 that is the single largest age bucket that we have aids cases and you can see that in the data or I might come back and say you know what between 30 to 39 that represents the two largest buckets that are quite a lot. No, but I might also want to come back and say do you know what there are close to 7000 cases of children under five years now to me depending on my objective that might be what I want to emphasize. Do you realize that there are kids under five with no fault of theirs and there are 7000 and if you want to say take it up to 12 years old there are 10000 children under the age of 12 who are suffering from AIDS? And these are children who have contracted AIDS for no fault of theirs. So, in some ways, I might be looking to emphasize that in some cases I might be embarrassing just a statistically that this is the most at-risk group, in the 25 to 39 range whatever it may be. So, depending on what is message what do I want to communicate here, and accordingly, you will construct the display. So, now the message is once the message is understood choosing a form becomes apparent. And so, for instance, if I were to look at it the thing that I will show is the one on the right side which is a very simple columnar display because it tells you very clearly where the peak is. The second thing is also the point I emphasized about using a line graph for categorical data it does it. So, now the data is categorical your bug indeed. So, it does not make sense to make a line graph. So, here is what I want to show. So, that is what I meant by saying once I get the data and I communicate this then the form dictionary form becomes very self-evident because it is a combination of the message the type of data and when you put those two together it is very self-evident that what type of display you want to choose. And then, of course, I have applied all the principles that I spoke about but because we are building up those principles, for instance, I have not annotated the data here There are things like that but this is done to illustrate the point and in fact, there are a few other things that I will talk about for instance even in this display If you look at the age buckets, I am not a big fan of those vertical spacing. I mean because what you expect me to do is lie down every time, I have to read this graph tilt back or tilt the laptop up and down and in fact it makes it worse if it is on a mobile device when I tilt it, it auto rotates. So, that does not help me either. So, there are others and that will come in to address those points when we talk about the design elements. So, there are some recommended best practices when we choose a form. So, one of the things again see look at this, I have sales numbers for two years Jan to December for two weeks. Now the message I want.is that you know there does not seem to be any kind of seasonality. That is the message I want to show. And the secondary message might be that the trend is all wrong in 2004 the trend is not right. Now if I throw it in a tabular display like this that message just does not come across, I mean if I show the table, it is impossible to show that you know maybe at some level a trend might be visible but if my purpose message is sure that there is no seasonality. The tabular display does not show it to me it does not help. But when I show it as a graphical display like that the lack of seasonality shows up very clearly that there is no seasoning. The trend is somewhat visible in the tabular display correct but it takes some effort,2004 trend is probably a little bit more evident than the 2003 trend because if you look at 2004 if you can top to bottom you can see it is monotonically reducing. 2003 is not that way. So, it is kind of goes up goes down and then if you look towards the end, it flattens out. So, the trend is not very clearly evident in the 2003 trend, again if I want to show that there is no seasonality very clearly the right display is big. Even for trend-right is preferred because if one goes and looks at how many seconds it took for you to understand that 2004 there is a downward trend 2003 was an upward trend by looking at the right graph and looking at the left table. Then you will understand what I mean by saying the form is you know the whole idea is how do you communicate that quickly without any loss in transmission. But I mean are there some general rules about when to use a table and when to use a chart there are some general rules. There are correct so for instance when you want to display a complete data set now it may not be practical but if you want to show this one. Where we are just showing the data, we may not necessarily be inferring something from that or I might see especially if you are looking at the customer service MPS course you might just want to show the kind of complete data in a table, right. You might want to show if you want to highlight a specific row if you want to show like all the product categories and you just want to show them, I want to factually tell you what is the sales of every product category. I am not trying to tell you that a is bigger than b or b is bigger than c. I am just trying to factually communicate that by stating these are my sales numbers. I am not trying to tell you that Tamil Nadu did more sales in Karnataka which did more sales in Maharashtra I am just trying to tell you that Tamil Nadu hit 20 million in sales and Karnataka 24 million in sales tabular display or if you wanted to say look focus here focus there you can highlight a certain row again emphasis. Now sometimes you will want to show how the numbers are calculated. So, you might say look the way it was calculated was revenue cost margins. So, sometimes when you show that it might be easier to show it than a tabular display where you can see how it is calculated. And it happens often right you will just say revenues cost margins or what you call wrong metrics right. You know we will call it to drum matrix revenue units and markets which helps this one chart will come exactly like when you want to show patterns, we want to show a change over time. So, for some cause and effect occasionally you have to be very careful about that I only want to compare two things. Comparison is probably the most common use case for charts. I mean essentially a pattern is effectively a meta comparison, I can compare two things when I show that same comparison multiple objects show a pattern or multiple, and when you show that over time it shows it becomes a time series. So, at some level, these are all kinds of specific instances of the same concept. So, visual comparison. So, data tables are used for two things one is just factually communicating the numbers without drawing inference. I want to show specific items where I will show this and highlight one correct and if you want to show visibility into the calculations okay you know what a b c this is how the margins stack up etcetera. So, that you can compare multiple things together right, and sometimes just if you have equal enough you have a wide number of columns and a whole number of rows. A graphical chart display might become overly complicated in which case the simplicity mandates that you just show it as a table and that is also important. So, for instance, if I have 20 let us say I have sales I have something and I want to show by state but then I also want to show unit sold revenue made margins made percentage margin what is the profit how many sales agents were there how many outlets were there and if you want to show 20 different metrics for those trying to show that in one graph will be impossible. You are better off showing it as a tabular display than going out and taking out individual metrics and showing graphs to show some comparisons. So, there are some quick tips about when to use a table and when to use a chart right that is what we were talking about just now. So, when you are as you are saying when you have just highlighted one component. So, if I have multiple things and I just want to highlight one component of the pie chart now I am going to put a huge rider on pie charts right in fact while I say this, I generally also say friends do not let friends use pickups. Pie charts are very difficult to interpret and probably the most grossly misinterpreted types of charts that you will see there. So, okay the problem with pie charts is seen when I want to show that one is largely dominant over the others. If you look at the blue light blue and dark blue, can you tell me which is bigger and by how much? Difficult little difficult yes, it is exactly the reason why pie charts are; So perceptual right remember what I said about we are very good at perceiving differences in length and relative differences in length. We are not very good at perceiving relative differences in the area especially the shapes are different if I draw a rectangle under the square and I tell you which covers are bigger and a circle and I ask you to tell me which of these covers a bigger surface area? Difficult very difficult and really with a pie chart that is what you are asking people to do you are asking them to compare two different areas of slightly different shape and trying to determine which is the higher which has a higher area. The same pie chart could be equivalently shown as a column chart. And the message comes across very clearly. So, the question is why would you choose a pie chart if the emphasis is to show the percentage breakdown where it all adds up to a hundred percent that I can you can make an argument for saying pie chart. But even there if you have two of them that are very comparable right will you cannot make out the distinction area-wise unless you annotate it. Exactly I was going to say annotation might help there correct. So, that is why I said. So, pie charts to me it is a chart of last resort right. So, which is why I say right friends do not let friends use my charts. So, that is a very important right, and similarly, if you want to show components of multiple items you know you use a stacked column chart or something like that. Now if you look at actually an individual column of the stack column chart that could be a pie chart effectively, So, you could make a pie chart and make it a simple column chart or a single column of the stacked component. Again, perceptually which is easier to understand, yeah but here in a column chart also comparing two orange regions and deciding which one is bigger might end up becoming difficult. So, and that is where you will also look at your choice of what are the categories on the x-axis and what are the categories that are on the stacked columns correct also makes a difference. So, and in fact, if you notice those guidelines that I have drawn on those between the orange that is precisely to address your point. Because you can easily see remember when we spoke about the components of perception where we spoke about thickness length orientation. You would see the base is the orientation whether it is getting thinner or thicker So, a simple line that draws these will show you whether the orange component is reducing in contribution, So, here you will very clearly see from the second column to the third column orange has held its blue has increased primarily at the expense of pink. Whereas that is very clear from those lines that you have drawn and between the first and the second one is very clear that blue has gained a percentage at the expense of orange. A very simple line kind of addresses those things yeah that helps small things. Now and you know look I mean instead of not getting through individual this one. But remember when I spoke about once you get the message the form is very evident that is the whole point if your message stresses this it is very evident. So, if your message is stressing correlation right you will do a scatter plot exactly. If your message is talking about change over time you will do a line chart you want to do an internet So that is what I meant by saying you know when you get a half volume outside the off stomp you are not going to try and do a hook shot true. So, to me just. So, this is just a quick recorder no hard and fast rule but broadly speaking that is how you think about it correct, and here are some examples for that right. So, for example, if you want to say sales of A bigger than sales of B so again this is one more thing where people might show it as a pie chart, that does not come across that you know a exceeds C by almost 2x yes whereas here it does come across yes once again yeah principle that the height is easily perceptible than the area. that is so critical So, very simple I will go to the next one right. If my message is that there is no apparent relationship between and there is no correlation correct a simple scatter plot with a regression line that tells you that you know effectively there is no correlation. But a pie chart does have its place right for example if you want to show the contribution. So, that is why I said but notice that I have taken the trouble to annotate it very carefully which is critical. Without annotation right honestly speaking it will be able to tell between C and B what is the relative strength you cannot difficult. So, when using if you do have to use a pie chart or if you do choose to use a pie chart correct make sure that annotations are there. But also remember this right the message here is that our competitor A has the competitor D has the smallest share. That pie chart is okay. If I want to do a comparison between A B C and D and show their relative strengths pie chart may not be appropriate but you may not the message is that that guy is the smallest no problem but if you want to come back and say you know if you combine D and C where they have the same market share as B okay. This will fail miserably, and the time series has always been classic. So, over some time correct and just again very clearly, I just want to show that look we have a problem EPS has been steadily declaring you know it is time for a new CEO that is what this is saying correct I mean you can say all that if you just say look EPS has been declining the CEO's got to go right you are a troublemaker. You show this graph then everybody says you know what you are not a troublemaker you are a whistleblower. And the last one is essentially an example of a box plot right where clearly those dots 214 observation number 213 observation number shows that those are outside the tail and probably, they represent the outliers in the data exactly. So, you can talk of I mean I cannot emphasize enough the concept of this outliers right. Because as you enter the workforce right the biggest thing you will see is that people will pick up an outlier and make a whole case as if that is a regular event. So, you know and they will call it oh I have anecdotal information I mean that is the buzzword right and this is what they teach you at all the MBA schools, anecdotal information right. Draw me a box plot and show me where it sticks and if your anecdote sits within the big yellow bar I will talk if it is sitting in that thing, I do not need to talk to you about that exactly correct. So, it is very critical I mean just to show that hey you know what this is what it is. So, because they will come back and say I spoke to this one customer and this one customer had this kind of feedback and hence we should change our entire product line. Are you bonkers, if that were the case right because when I talk to my daughter, I will have to rebuild the entire Akasa model and introduce business class seating, a very nice example is very nice because she just looked at it and said oh no business class of this place? So, you know and if I take that one example without understanding where it sits on the outlier chart then you know I will have a whole fleet of business classes. Fortunately, that is not going to make too much money in India probably, yes on that front Rahul I think I have eliminated the probability we are very clear that is not the way to go into the Indian aviation market and the data clearly shows that right. So, all right okay. So, we have knocked down two out of the three components of the process of designing the visualization for the particular data type. First, we discussed the importance of messaging, and then we spoke about various forms that immediately come from the message right. So, we still have to discuss designing the form but let us do that in the next session. So, let us end the session here having knocked down 3 out of 2 out of the three components of the design. Design of visualization process. So, let us end the second session here.
