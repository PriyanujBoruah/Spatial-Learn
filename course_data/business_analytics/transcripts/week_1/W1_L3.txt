Welcome back folks this is the third session on visualization. We were speaking about the process of visualization and the two important components were first of all trying to understand what message do we want to convey. And once the message is clear what form of visualization should be used and Anand is very happy to give the example of the cricket short where if the ball is outside the stamp no chance of, we looking it on a deep square leg. So, let us come to the third component which is designing the form that we have selected in the second phase of the visualization part over to Anand. Why designing important? Well, designing is important because you have got a good message you got a good form correct and the design can really completely detail the community message that you are trying to communicate. Almost a personal favourite is using 3D representation right absolutely 0 value to the message and that is being communicated correctly somebody decided. So, in fact, it takes it away right because if you look at those the bars that you see of the 25 you know which is that the two dollars bars which are 30 to 34 and 35 to 39, right. It is much more difficult to tell whether there is a difference between those two when you use 3D effects. Because of the shadow, honestly speaking my submission is again going back to purpose. What purpose does that 3D representation do whatsoever? In this case, at least right it is a harmless I will for your cases where you can be co counterproductive. I do not know if you have an example of a 3D pie chart I have it on the next slide. So, I and again three same things I 3D effects that look this is very still same as the data is you know the same as what we saw the previous chart. But then we have got this 3D pie chart. If you look at it right if you look at let me, see the numbers a little bit right. If you look at our company which has 34 and the competitor here with us, 26 on the right side can pie chart on the left side it looks like our company and competitors have the same share. All was no, yes but look at the chart on the right side. yes, correct and if I wanted to do this, I will switch it around and rotate this pie chart. So, that competitor D which is a yellow slice can appear to be the same size as us. So, 3D effects have zero purposes and in some cases are bad this to me goes into almost deceit. Because the left side pie chart without annotations essentially says that our company and competitor have the same share, yes. So, that is why 3D effects are very dangerous, and at least you know when I used to review presentations, I would stop people whenever is a came in with a 3D chart I know I do not know why I do not know what reason that is why they got the message. I mean they are using 3D because 3D charts are so common everywhere today. So, I have a simple movie I will not look at anybody who comes into a 3D chart and it took me a while to get the message across. And I had to use multiple tools to get the message across but the message was and I would say you know you should never be used. And if you ask me get this particular slide and stick it up on your wall because this will tell you exactly why you should not use 3D effects. And the same thing goes for even the line charts right we put too many things often there. Now different perspective right again you are showing monthly this one moreover the same we have seen this example before. We are talking about on the left side multiple things here right. Look at the title let us start with the title, right? it just says your cumulative unit sales actual versus plan. That is a statement of fact right. But look at the second one where I put this right. Sales have exceeded plan by 30000 the message is very clear very clear on the left side I have to calculate and not only do I have to calculate I have to look at the horizontal the red line show me and this one is about hundred extra hundred more what is the difference. So, you know what is it that it will be 300 and 177 correct. So, you know what I said you know we said up for value labels wherever possible and you can delete some labels to avoid clutter. So, if you notice I have not labelled every single data point yes, I have to open to label every alternate one, yes. Why, it reduces clutter, and also, and since I have allocated that I do not need those horizontal grid lines once you annotate it you do not need those correct. So, again just look at aesthetically simpler right it is much easier more distraction right. It is the equivalent of listening to Beethoven with you know background white noise with some guy doing construction work in your house. I must comment that your analogies are as visually appealing as, I mean as they can have no I mean that is the point-like how to get the point across how to get the message across. So, the chart is Beethoven here on those red lines are the construction noise. And it is like correct but I mean in general by designing phase of the visualization we are trying to say that well may make it easier to guys exactly. But I am also calling out to see if even the title the key message I want to say is that you know cumulative actual sales through July we are ahead of the plan by 30000 I mean so, very precise and it is got the message across I see this. So, somebody says fantastic us a good job online. I mean it says I mean you want to say things that you want to draw attention towards right otherwise you are just keeping it open for discussion. So, look for this one I am going to do right? you know doctor colour that is why the director we should do it when I was in the department and he was ahead of the department with chemical legendary. He had a very interesting self-way of saying things right he says look if I show you an apple and you tell me it is an orange you are confessing to two kinds you do not know an apple and you do not know an orange understand principles, right? So, if you want to get something of course do not distract on other things because by definition people will draw their attention will be drawn to that and they will focus on that. So, you have to be very precise about what you what do you have to show. So, you know if you draw a different real accuracy and position when you visualize you have to be both accurate and precise. So, that completes our three-part process of designing visualization tools understanding the message conveying that message through a particular tool, and then designing that tool carefully right. I have a curiosity question for Anand. So, essentially all these charts and tables and these numbers get into what is called as data dashboards. So, what are our data dashboard? Dashboard right I mean and this is something that is there in every single I mean everybody wants to talk about dashboard. In fact, I remember seeing I think was it a department strip or something like that right when you had a serial executive saying you know and given that is coming up on Christmas gift right. So, an executive is writing a letter to Santa saying dear Santa all I want for this Christmas is a nice dashboard due from finance already has one. So, look I the whole idea of a dashboard is hey how do you this photo of individual graphs individual display self. A dashboard in my mind the system ah a collection of related displays with some purpose right. And you know no problem I think this was this I love this because it was created by, I think Steven Fue was considered to be, you know extremely good researcher and a well-known authority on dashboard design right. Dashboard definition is you know it is a visual display and very nicely where every word is important here. So, a visual display of the most important information is needed to achieve one or more objectives. Consolidated to a single screen, so it can be monitored and understood at a glance, every word here becomes critical. At least the ones where I reduce the font those you can encode it is a visual display end of the day correct what does it mean by visual displays that I see it and I comprehend correctly. Why do I say it is a visual display? Very often more often than not you will hear this thing called the interactive dashboard where you will see a dashboard and then people will say you can click here and we can show this and you can show that. No, I mean it is supposed to be visual right you do not necessarily have to make it interactive. I think you only show the most important information that is needed to achieve a particular object. I need the CEO to understand where we stand from a revenue perspective or a business performance perspective. It has to be on a single screen correct do not want to scroll up and down. And very easily more understood I look at it I know what happened the in fact very name dashboard was borrowed from the car automobile dashboard. I already said when you design a dashboard you think of the car dashboard. Can you imagine if you are driving a car and the dashboard requires you to reach in and push a button to look at the fuel consumption, push another button to understand what your speed is? I mean that speed display tells you that you know you are 32% over the other speed limit and that you know 78% of the and below your speed is that all relevant. And also, something that says that 14% of people in the age group 18 to 22 like this student on Facebook is that relevant. What I need to know is how fast am I driving it right. So, again it only shows me how fast am I driving. It does not show me anything for me anything which is not needed correct. I do not have to do anything to get that information I can look at it at the answer I can look at it at the corner of my eye and I will get the information. And it is all there on one screen. So, to me and somebody defines a dashboard this principle has to be critical. If you have to do all of these activities and you are throwing all this stuff onto a dashboard and then you are going to crash the car. The same way you put that on a business dashboard is useless and my personal favourite can be a real-time dashboard. A real-time cannot be a dashboard is meant where you look at it you glance at it you get information and then you go do what you have to do. A real-time is something that you are monitoring. If there is a reason to monitor something real-time, we should not be a dashboard it should be an entity. So, so these are all important things to consider when you design a dashboard. To me, I just absolutely love this definition right because it hits every single aspect of what a dashboard should be and what it should not be right. It should be at the number of times I have seen dashboard design with a tabular display where you have to scroll. I mean scroll some tell me this whole idea of the dashboard is so that you know I can put multiple matters on display at the same time. So, that I can say this is going down understood. Now if you put tabs then by definition, they are not on the same page yes if you have to scroll by the deficient amount on the same page and then what was the intent of food? So, and this is how one trap people fall into when designing dashboards right essentially is this. You will design a dashboard and it starts off with a nice simple concept like this. Then somebody will come back and say hey why do not we draw our social media data on top of that? why do not we draw our HR headcount data top on that, why do not we draw that also right then they need to get called an executive dashboard and you know what they feel proud of it for the fact that every carrier is this plan on one dashboard. It does not make sense at all correct. So, the director of IIT, Madras wants to see the dashboard. He wants to see how many students are enrolled how many faculty are there how many support staff what is your cost running operating cost incidents etcetera. He does not need to know what the GPA of the distribution of GPA of students was and you know how many students ah you know were absent for a particular class. He just needs to know all that. So, you have to think about those things and not try to overturn them with information. And then so they can do that correct. So, are you suggesting that before we design a dashboard there has to be some kind of a Pareto analysis saying figure out what is most? Actually, yes, I know it is not a question of Pareto analysis right because you know the problem with Pareto is earlier than you know it is a question of arbitrarily where it draws a line. You have to go back and say what is the purpose of this dashboard yes and what do you need to put there that helps the user of the dashboard achieve that precisely yes nothing else. It is not a Pareto. So, let us say the purpose of the dashboard is I just want to look at one metric and one metric only then only that does not show anything else. So, what would be the basic design principle of a dashboard? So, which means I do not know it is very similar to the same thing right the dashboard I mean even while I have a picture here even this is a very cluttered dashboard in my opinion. But it helps highlight the point. So, what we will say is that you will show the big picture. So, there are a glad you will see certain critical things and you know there is some color-coded red yellow green whatever you want to have that to draw attention. You know use colours you can zoom in on specific correct and then from there, you will provide a link to say here you know if you want to see more details you click here and you will it will take elsewhere to look at the other details. So, do not cramp other details into the dashboard. That should be simple. So, which means I see it I should see the big picture, this one gets a sense of the metrics in some nice suitable display. If you want to sort of revenue you may want to just show only the revenue or sometimes you will say look let me show you the trend of the revenue as well I think because the trend is also important. No problem but I can zoom in I can expand it and then I can click to get into supporting detail. Now, why is this happening? Why is that happening? And many other dashboards support that. Now that is in this case it might be a data warehouse monitoring dashboard. So, you can click that I say I see something wrong with the data warehouse system I will click that I go to the data warehouse dashboard correct. I see something wrong with the you know website I will go up and look at the website having the dashboard. So, yes there are long as big questions asked? Whenever somebody looks at a dashboard question should be raised correct one is what happens. But the solution to those answering those questions is completely separate dashboard only those questions I have heard people say that right when they say I understand that a glance or you should answer all the potential questions that have been covered? No, it should not. You should have additional information additional link additional accessible information that answers those questions but that is separate if you called that separately. You are trying to cram all that into the dashboard essentially you get you would mess all over the place like no you cannot drive the car you are only you are spending all your time reading the dashboard. That is what happens. So, that was the basic understanding but essentially our dashboards are you suggesting that there should be a separate dashboard for finance and there should be a separate dashboard for marketing but you are saying we are not saying that at all we are saying find out the purpose design in dashboard correct. So, typically yes for instance since you brought a finance marketing, that is a CEO dashboard that we come up with which will give some key metrics. Now there might be one or two critical metrics or that will show over things that will show up for representing finance and marketing. The details so far as I might want to say how much do I spend on marketing this month. The CEO dashboard I might not say how much was spent in Tamil Nadu versus Karnataka versus Kerala it is a separate market and if you say look looks like your spend of monthly spend this increase in your marketing why is that happening? You may have a separate dashboard look over the last few months we will increase a lot of spending in Kerala in South India which is why it is increasing. We have launched a new product and that is why we are spending more you know one of the things I should also emphasize video talking about marketing and this one and more correct. So, purpose and more or less one more thing I should emphasize talking about marketing and this one. When you design especially when you use colours correct accessibility becomes a big issue. Why so, for instance typically it is very common to use red, green, and yellow to highlight metrics that are good, bad, or need monitoring correctly. What happens if the person reading the dashboard happens, we can? So, then your red-yellow-green and if they have red-green colour blindness you lost the fundamental premise of why you are highlighting it red in green. So, there has to be designed for accessibility and red, yellow, green is universally accepted for good balance right. So, but then you have to have the ability to be able to customize it or at least end-user to come back and say look I have a certain visual impairment and it should switch over to 3 Different colours that are easily distinguishable but at the same time even for somebody who I colour blind. And in fact, when we got a lot of websites, they give you colour palettes that ah while they may not appear to be the same colours as you see it to a colourblind person they will appear they are guaranteed to appear as distinct colours so for different types of colour blindness. So, sometimes you know choosing the palette is also important right. And then I saw him. So, when I saw this red that is the first thing that struck me you know what if the person here, I am looking at it when colour blind they will not know to understand between which system is red and which system is green. And you know as fundamental and communication error that could be right correct. So, you are right. So, to the point right that you have to have these kinds of high level and then break down dashboards and then you know further breakdowns and things like that. And you can always have them on link interlink where if a question comes up you can always pull up the other dashboard and then dig. But do not try to bring everything into the same dashboard, correct. Thank you Annad thank you for your insights that does help in understanding why visualization is important and once you have understood the purpose how to go about doing it? So, thanks a lot, and hopefully this session is helpful. So, thank you, now always a pleasure for her anytime happy to help thank you. So, let us end the session here.
