Hello everyone welcome to this first tutorial of this course I am Dr. Jaimini and today I show you uh some examples uh of misleading visualizations. And in this week you have already learned the importance of visualization in making decisions. You have also learned different dues and tones while representing data to avoid any ambiguity as well as any scope for misinterpretation by the user. For this tutorial I have collected a few cases from the newspaper and wherein data has been wrongly represented that can mislead the readers in analyzing a particular scenario. Now let us see our first example while summarizing data in a bar chart you should take utmost care in setting the x axis and y axis. Now look at this bar chart. The chart shows the number of people in US receiving some form of federal welfare. During the year 2009 till 2011 across different quarters now by looking at this chart what comes to your mind. It appears that the welfare the welfare problem is spiraling out of control in the US over the years across the quarters. However here is the catch just look at the y axis you can see that the y axis actually does not start from 0 .So the range of y axis values are between 94 million and 108 million and this is not very big range. So, if you plot these data in a bar chart where the y axis starts from zero the length of all these bars also will be of similar height. So, that means the problem is not that worse. Now let us see our next example. Look at this pie chart. The pie chart represents some result of some opinion polls in the US presidential run. And generally not always in a pie chart the edges should sum up to 100% of the data but if you could see the pie chart you will see that the summation is more than 100%. So, this is not accurate pie chart. Now this chart represent the data on active Covid-19 cases in Chennai between July 31st and August 6th. So, the intent of this chart is to show a comparative study between July and August in terms of the Covid cases. However the stack chart is not an appropriate chart in this case because it is very difficult to compare these two datasets using the stack bar chart and you have actually need to focus on the neighbouring part of every every bar. So, the bar chart becomes redundant here. Actually a bar chart with two series of columns for every categories would have been a better representation of this data and that also will be will be a very helpful for the reader to have a comparative study. Now look at this chart. This chart shows the increase of petrol prices over the years from 2004 to 2008 it also shows the percentage increase of petrol prices across the years. So, from 2004 to 2009 the petrol prices jump by 20.5 percentage from 33.71 rupees to 40.6 rupees between 2009 and 2004 it has jumped by 25 or 75 percent from 40.6 rupees to 71.41 rupees. From 2014 to 2018 the price is actually increased from 71.41 rupees to 80.73. But by looking at the chart what you can see the length of the bar in 2018 should have been more than 2014 but this is 13 percent and it it appears that from this chart actually the price has gone down from 2014 to 2018 because the arrow the arrow has been marked downward. So, this is not a correct chart. Actually the analyst might have intended to show that the percentage increase actually is dropped. From 75.8 percent to 13 percent but in fact in that case also since the increase is positive your bar chart in 2018 the lengths would be more than 2014. So actual chart might look like this. So, it will gradually increasing from 2004 to 2018 okay. In the lecture, the emphasis is given a point that a 3D pie chart is often misleading and here I have collected two examples to show to prove this. So, if you see in this chart generally human eyes are very sensitive to the area occupied by particular colour. In a 3D pie chart the colour of this is a similar is same as colour of the surface. So, if you compare the same 3D and 2D the area of this 3D looks bigger than that area of the same 2D diagram. So, if you compare this two charts and for item T no for the item C, you may infer that item A appears having lesser share than item C but if you see the 2D diagram this actually the item is shared is almost twice as that of the item C. So, this actually gives a misleading interpretation. And this is the other diagram here example. Here actually if you see, if you compare both these charts. In the 2D uh you can clearly see that the share of item is A lot more than that of B. However in a 3D pie chart you can see that the both the both A and B peace share look similar. So, here are a few examples of misleading visualizations. You can also search in your day to day life from the examples from the article from the newspapers or the media if you find some examples do post it on the course forum, thank you.
