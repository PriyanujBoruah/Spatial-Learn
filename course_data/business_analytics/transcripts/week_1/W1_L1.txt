Good morning everyone, welcome to this session on data visualization. We are lucky to have Annad Srinivasan with us today, joining in from Bangalore. Anand is an IITM alumnus B. Tech 1995 is that correct Anand, yes and he has been a very amazing data scientist throughout his 26, 27 year old career has worked with multiple industries Airline industries, Saber technologies, Dell. He was with the senior management at Go Air and now he is about to start a new venture, a new airline which is going to be launched very soon. I can say that formally right Anand, yes you can say that formally Rahul, perfect. So, very glad that recently Anand was listed as one of the top 10 data scientists in India. So, very lucky to have you Anand on joining us today for the session, my pleasure Rahul it is always good to touch base with you and happy to help in any way I can. So, today's session is going to be on how you see data that is going to be the primary purpose. How do you represent data and most of the ideas are essentially Anand's idea that we are going to discuss and therefore we have Anand in the session today. So, let us start. So, first of all, why do you think we need to emphasize on visualization of data? So, you know there is a cliche right I mean a picture being worth a thousand words fundamentally that still holds true. End of the day when you look at analytics as a whole the fundamental purpose is you know people talk about data science etcetera. The only reason that field exists is to help businesses make better decisions, correct. If you count that then I mean that you question the very we need for the analytics function as a whole right. So, I have always been an exponent of saying look, it does not matter what kind of decisions are based on whatever analysis. Part of that is to say why we might build all kinds of sophisticated models you have to understand that decision makers you have to be able to present them that result of that analysis not necessarily the process but the result of that analysis in a very precise concise and consumable format which will go back and say hey if I do this this will this is likely to happen is this a good decision or a bad decision, correct. I think so, to me that is the crux of the problem right I mean let us face it in the forest and nobody heard it. So, you might have the greatest analysis but if good decisions are not being made based on that analysis then really what is the point of doing that analysis. So, I think that is where the visual ability to communicate and communicate visually to decision makers is a very, very critical part of analytics. In fact, that is my pet peeve if you want to call it that. It is like you know a lot of people that talk about analytics or you know people that teach analytics they do not emphasize this component enough. And people who have been endless will tell you how long the number of times come out to me after a long meeting with senior senior management and then come back and say oh we had this great model we had this great analysis but somewhere the whole discussion got derailed into something else and people did not really understand the core of what it is. And we ended up wasting time discussing some trivial aspects which were not core to the analysis that was presented all the time. And part of that is it is not that the management is sitting there saying look let us have chai samosa pakora and let us just white time away that they are there for a reason they want to understand the issue they want to understand the solutions. They want to make decisions but somewhere there the analyst has to take responsibility to communicate that effectively and I think that is where visualization comes in in a very, very critical way. So, I think I cannot emphasize the importance of visualization enough. So, in fact I am very happy Rahul that you are touching upon this as part of the course because I am not seeing this exercise because they want to quickly jump into statistical modeling recreation models and more importantly somewhere you know someone seems to how quickly can we get to AI and then I think emphasizing the fundamentals is so, critical lovely to see that, thank you. And not only for the corporate managers right, I mean I think psychologically also human beings are tuned to see pictures better than words right, yes absolutely absolutely right. In fact that is the thing right I mean this is well known right vision is the most powerful sense that we have there right. In fact I think there have been studies that talk about cognitive studies right 70% of the information we consume is visual right auditory sensory touch. So, I mean you know people can sit and debate the 70% 30% you know like I always say right 85% of statistics are made up on the fly right. But that being said, I do not think so. I think it is beyond debate that vision happens to be the most powerful perception that we have. So, which is why visual communication is so important right and that is what we will talk about as we talk through some of these things, perfectly. And it doesn't really matter what kind of data you have, data can be numerical data can be continuous, it can be discrete and we have visualization tools right. We have visualization tools for each data type that I mean really there is no dearth of visualization techniques. So, interesting that your choice of words I mean I would emphasize the techniques more than the tools right. You know I think people once you understand the techniques you understand the fundamentals the tool is just a medium right. So, when you say visualization tool maybe perspective I am thinking of software tools that help you do visualization that is not the issue, correct. So, I would emphasize techniques more than tools because really what we want to teach people are the techniques. Then the tool just becomes a means of implementing that technique correct correct that is that is we wish to this that is what we wish to discuss in the session today I mean essentially what are the what are the core principles on which the visualization should be based irrespective of what data do you have that you want to represent. And you know what the other thing is. I think you know people need to understand these kinds of categorical numerical discrete continuous data. Because the very nature of the data right dictates how you represent them visually okay, correct. The number of times I have seen people show me you know trending data using categorical data, right. So, that is the whole point right you know if you are going to show me say a line chart which makes sense for you know time continuous trending kind of a data. But then you decide to draw a line chart on categorical data somewhere there you know when you say okay between this point and this point you have drawn a line connecting these two points which is exactly between these two, right. So, and you know and these kinds of things the amazing thing is you know when you when you actually talk about it you know everybody will smile and say yeah come on I mean like obviously is not that obvious part of the funny part depending the so on your point of view is the fact that it happens so frequently okay uh. So, I think it is just like you know part of it is tools that is the reason why I emphasize the difference between tools and techniques because what happens is you pull up the data you go to excel or something and then draw click and say create chat it just it just it is a it is a dumb tool right it just does not work. So, you know spending that little bit of time and hopefully the points we consider today when we discuss will get people to think for you know two seconds before creating a chart, right. And the two seconds will save you two hours of debate time when you are presenting your results precisely, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. So, what do you think are the general benefits of visualizing our visual representation of the data? See benefits see the whole idea is communication right I mean there is only one reason why look if you think about it business has to improve. So, we do analysis etc to help the business improve and we need to communicate that to the stakeholders. So, the right decisions can be made very simply. Our objective as analysts is to communicate that idea. So, visualization is our language of; so I could almost call visualization the language of the analyst because let us face it you go sit in a boardroom they are not going to be interested in looking at your python code, yeah, correct. So, visualization is the language of analysts when they talk to the business stakeholder right. Now and by the way interestingly visualization is also the language by which the analyst understands the real world. Because the right visual representation can actually give you a very good view of what could be the core problem and then actually put you on the right path to solving the problem, yeah. If you do not have a good visual representation the problem itself may not necessarily be evident. So, when you say it is visual the stuff you talk about cognitive processes here yes that is that that is what the communication is visual representation visual communication. And obviously communication is to make the cognitive process easier. So, part of what we do visualization is to say look, the other person has to understand the concept and we have to make it easier for them to understand the concept, not harder right. There are times when the visual representation itself is. So complicated that you know people spend more time understanding the visual than what it is trying to communicate, yeah yeah yeah. So, I call that the equivalent of going to a foreign country and saying you know where the washroom is and the person gives you an answer, right. You spend more time trying to understand what the person was saying rather than where the washroom is, yeah. It might be just easier for the person to point, yeah yeah yeah. So, you know, having the wrong visualization is the equivalent of getting a very simple answer in a completely spend foreign language. If you take more time understanding what the person will say you know and rather than saying okay look I asked you for the washroom you pointed me there problem solved this is thank you, correct correct correct correct. And I mean I have experienced this also I mean. So, many times we take up a constraint assignment and at the end of the assignment you are supposed to make a presentation to the senior management. And uh, gently the person comes to you before the meeting and says boss do not present your math and do not present your code. Tell us what it means to us, right?'' So, unless we speak the language that people understand. So that they can make better decisions about our model and our code is useless, absolutely right. And you know and you know see someone's right I mean which is kind of straying away from the core concept of what we are talking about here. I think as engineers right we also fall into the trap of confusing effort for importance right yes. So, you know you might have spent 50% of your time right cleaning up the data and lining up the data correctly and maybe only 30% actually building the model or you know or say let us say 60, 70-30 70% and you know typical 70 or you will spend you know just cleaning up the data understanding this. That does not mean you know that your process of cleaning up the data has to consume 70% of your time; the time of your final presentation, yeah right. So, so. so we do fall into the trap of mistaking effort for importance, right. So, it does happen. So, that is part of the visualization is to say look but I think that is slightly outside the scope of what we are trying to discuss here but you know also be cognizant of that. So, I think when we talk about this we will talk about you know what is the purpose of this presentation. So, maybe some of those things will be touched upon as we go through, correct, correct. So, essentially by visualization we mean visually highlighting a few things for example through the form or through color or through spatial representations right, yeah. So, see when you try to build a visual representation right and these are all I mean if you really think about it all charts that you do use one of these techniques to and these are the things that the human eye spots very easily correct. So, for instance right I mean if you look at it we are trying very easily to kind of get a sense of identifying the shortest bar in those four lines right. I do not have to tell you that look mark 2o is shorter right. We are I just by looking at it I know correct the amazing thing is we are also very good at very quickly evaluating by how much it is shorter I mean somebody will look at this and say I would say it is about 15 shorter okay it is I mean you it may be 15 18 14.25 but bottom line is we without saying anything I look at it I get a very good idea, righ. Similarly the width right I mean you know when you highlight it you know when you use bold text stresses of normal text. Again we pick up on that very, very quickly right of course orientation size shape you know and obviously using enclosure to highlight which is you know when you draw a person. So, these are all attributes of visual perception and the whole idea is when you do. When you communicate you have to think about which of these can I use to draw the user's attention to the important part. How do you get them to focus on what is important and how do you get them to not focus on what is not important, correct uh. So, like they say right, what you say is as important as what you do not show or what you show is as important as what you do not show. You know I might have made a crack about you know beachwear but maybe not appropriate for the current audience. So, we leave that as it is, yeah okay. So, okay now let us get down to the core of what we are trying to say right. You have often spoken about the four important kinds of umbrella principles of visualization, Can you elaborate on that right. So, I mean something that I mean you know I honestly speaking unfortunately I would like to know if I could I would go back and say that did I get this idea from uh. So, at the risk of saying you know it was pleasing I was inspired right at some point I might have seen this somewhere but I kind of it resonated. So, I kind of made it a cornerstone of a lot of times when I talk to people in terms of this. So, if there is somebody out there who actually came up with these things you know, consider the credit date granted, right right. So, the four things I always talk about is when you present a chart when you build this one. These are four things that you have to absolutely follow and in fact write it down and go through a checklist. First is to know the purpose. What is the purpose of putting this visual representation together, right? It has to have a purpose it is and the purpose cannot be you know let me demonstrate my mastery of the charting tool, okay. So, the purpose is why does this graph have to be here? Why does this chart have to be here? Why does this representation have to be here? I want to use the word graph chart and visual representation interchangeably but you know sometimes in cases there could be different. Once you have a purpose correct that purpose will automatically determine what form of representation it will do, correct. Second, I always ensure the integrity of what you represent, right? And you know typically you will have errors of omission and commission when you are presenting data, right. To me that is a non-negotiable right integrity of the data because even if it is by omission or commission. Even if there is a small error in the data correct it will and that could be in the most trivial you know sidebar after this one but it will derail the entire analysis and essentially you know even if it was oh you know it is actually something I made a typo and I put it into this presentation, correct. Once it gets caught the integrity of the entire presentation will be questioned. So, integrity is absolutely critical and it is non-negotiable. correct and you know I always talk about you know data inc and minimizing non-data which is the equivalent of saying you know what spend ink on the items that you want to show do not spend ink on items that you it is not which is not critical to the thought process. So, maybe just moving on will show your data and annotate yourself with the integrity of it as well, right. So, let us take this one by one uh. So, let us understand what we mean by purpose right. So, by purpose we mean the actual business problem that we are trying to solve, right. So, no, not really necessarily Rahul. So, because see if I build a chart or a visual right it is a one step in the larger question that I am trying to answer. So, which means that this is because let us face it right, the business problem I am trying to solve is not going to be solved by one visual representation, right yeah. I might be going through a slide and you know a series of slides, this one the purple. When I put a representative graphic together the purpose of that should say this is going to make my ability to communicate this more complicated concept of this one is that much easier it sets the stage in some cases or this might emphasizes this, correct, okay. Another way to do it is if you look at even this particular graphic that we are seeing on the screen, correct. Because I always talk about the umbrella principles, right. What do I mean by umbrella principles in English? It covers everything, correct, yeah. And if you look at that little handle that I have shown there, if I go back and say what the purpose of having that handle is, it emphasizes the concept of the umbrella principle, yeah correct. So, it is there for a reason, correct. So, which means literally everything that there has to be a reason. So, if you look at it and say why is this there, what is the purpose of having that particular graphic on the screen? You should have a clear purpose, right. Now the purpose again the reason I say a purpose is not necessarily the message what we are talking about how we communicate the message, right. The message could be communicated over a series of visual representations, okay and each of those will have a purpose that contributes towards communicating that message, okay okay okay, right. So, understood and in fact when people are starting off I always encourage you to whenever you put this together right what is the purpose? Does it serve a purpose? If it does not serve a purpose remove it. Sometimes and you know there is one thing to say it does not remove it sometimes certain visual objects will actually have a counter purpose, correct, yeah yeah. So, you have to be very careful and focus on what you want to say correctly. So, I always encourage you to know when you are putting thought through and say that what is the purpose of having this visual representation, this slide, this graphic whatever it may be, right. But just have that in fact I used to tell people to write it down, right saying what is the purpose right. So, nice, correct, correct . I understand the difference between the message that we want to convey and the purpose for which this visual tool is being used. I understand, exactly, exactly , exactly , right , okay. Second thing was integrity yeah and this I can see all all too often right. It is pretty immediate. So, for instance right I mean you know just to give an example you should not be presenting in a way to destroy right. So, if you look at the graphic on the right that shows you, let us say typically earnings per share is this one. Now here is the beauty of it right. When you look at the graph on the left on the graph on the right without paying attention the first thing that one would say is that oh my god the when I see the graph on the left it is. So, volatile, yeah right in reality it is not correct. I mean look if somebody pulls out a calculator and says okay 164, 220 what is the percentage but remember the thing is about how usually we see length and we are very quick to measure. So, when I look at the 1999 versus 2000 right on the left graph one would say we grew six x or five almost yeah yeah correct right that is that was not the reality right because what somebody has done is you can see the access has been cut off, correct, yeah. Now and in fact when I say this right somebody will come back and say no no I want to emphasize the variability, correct. Now and that is where I say it is being the integrity is lost because the reality is the variability is minuscule, correct yeah yeah. We are exaggerating on the left hand side yeah. So, by chopping it off; so, a lot of people say no I want to emphasize the difference or the variability I said in the grand scheme of things the variability is nothing. So, they will say I want to show that north is so much better than south or sales in east are so much bigger. But in reality the per capita might be you know off by you know 0.5% but by chopping it off I will make it up here it is off by you know 30 40%, correct. um This is you will be; I am amazed at how frequently this is used especially in media exactly. I was going to say that, yes, okay. And their equivalent of caviar temper is they will have a small little wiggly thing at the bottom to show that access has been cut, yeah yeah yeah. Right. And you know and when I see this graph that is the first thing I notice right the small wiggly squiggly line at the bottom yeah yeah. So, this is very common in media right and you know when you look at it then you and amazingly enough when you look at it from the lens of the integrity is being gone you actually will understand the bias of the storyteller in terms of what they are trying to say here, yeah yeah yeah that could become very evident, right. So, uh. So, so to me how do you eliminate as a storyteller as a media person I need to be making a statement of fact right by chopping it off you are not stating fact right. So, to me integrator integrity is so critical right I mean I mean and I chose the word the left the graph on the left is deceitful it is a very strong word and I chose it deliberately because I believe it is deceitful it is communicating our wrong picture, precisely, yeah. But the sad reality is exactly what you said you see every day in print media in the news media in the electronic media you see this every day yes and you know the most common technique used, right. So, again as um analytics analytics professionals correct and when we are presenting energy it is our responsibility to make sure these kinds of things do not happen, precisely yeah yeah yeah. Now moving on to the third thing about maximizing what we wish to highlight on the data inc, yeah. So, again, right , very simple. I am a big believer in simplicity, right? So, I have used this as an example. If you think about it right, all the gridlines and the yellow colors are all what I call non-data ink, correct. It does not communicate one mile of additional information for me. Whereas the title that I put there called totals by specialty is correct that actually communicates something to me, yes yes right. So, to me that is data inc it is communicating something to me correct the numbers are communicating something to me right. So, any amount of ink that you use to communicate something is useful right um anything else is styling. Now styling there are times when you have you know I you know it is not about oh there should be no styling understand this even the table that I have on the right there is some amount of styling that is being done, yeah. But even that styling is also very specific for a purpose again going back to purpose. So, if you go back and say what is the purpose of putting those cells in a yellow background, yeah there is nothing. Then so again it tells back to the same thing what is the purpose of that. So, if I go back and say what is the purpose of the title it has a very clear purpose it tells me what this means is what uh. So, again going back see and you know also if you look at it that is the difference between purpose and message, yeah, correct correct correct. So, the purpose is it just tells me that it is caused by speciality. The message might be that PCP and PT dermatologists are the highest, yeah yeah correct correct correct. So, the difference between a purpose and devices. So, anything that you do any color ink that you use that does not serve a purpose and communicate information to the end user is non-data ink, right and again you cannot eliminate it. So, you want to one call the lines that we have the horizontal and the vertical lines to be non-data right. So, that is why I said; minimize your non-data ink and maximize your data ink and you cannot eliminate it correctly. And the last point about annotating the data is essentially to help the users is that correct yes. So, again right, very simple, just look at the two graphs. What the left graph does is it gives you an axis and then you know somebody has got to hold a finger or a ruler across this to measure and read off what those bars are, yeah yeah. It is simpler to get rid of the access tick marks but annotate the data. Now it is much easier just visually just looks so much easier to read, correct, correct. So, much easier on the right hand side, yes. So, uh. So, annotate the data right now and people will see this as the graphs get more and more crowded and you have more and more data points. Annotation tends to become a bit sticky because it starts looking very messy, right, yeah yeah. So, fair enough, fair enough right. So, again you go back and annotate critical points you do not have to annotate every single data point okay things like that. So, you know, let us say you have 300 points on the x-axis and then you know, can you imagine a graph which has 300 little labels like that? It just becomes noise. Right for annotation it is important but it is judicious and selective on the annotation, precisely I mean yeah. Simply because it is listed as one of the important principles, do not blindly use it, it has been our consistent message, yes, correct okay. So, these are four principles and my submission is that if you follow these principles right. Let us put it this way you will not be wrong in what you're presenting, right, yeah. So, I would say this as an actual put it and necessary but not sufficient condition for optimal representation of data, yeah, correct, right right yeah. In words that I will appeal to the audience of this class right these principles are necessary but not sufficient, correct correct correct correct. Now let us focus on the process of designing the visualization techniques and tools right. So, you have a three-step process: first of all trying to understand the message, then choosing a particular form and then designing that particular tool right. So, so again this here also when you say define the message what are you trying to communicate right and again there is a purpose what is the purpose of this thing. So, if you are looking at it as a single visual component right or a sub element of a graph then you can think in terms of a purpose or it could be or what is the message I am trying to communicate with this chart correct uh. So, there is a bit of a back and forth between a message and a purpose, the distinction I made but the concept is the same right um what is the message right. And how do I ensure that when the person reading sees the graph he or she gets the same message that I am trying to communicate, yes that is very important. That is the key right that yeah what is being transmitted has to be received it has to be what is received right no loss in translation. Yes no loss in translation checksum should be there yes uh. So, that is fun and that is the key right. So, if I am trying to say something to somebody because you are not always going to be standing around trying to gain an ability to explain that graph. Somebody is going to pull up that graph or chart or whatever it is without the benefit of you having standing next to them, yeah correct. Which means that it is your responsibility to ensure that anybody or random let us say somebody has printed that and you see that graph when you buy peanuts on the beach on the paper that is that when you open it up you should be able to understand what the graph is, exactly, yeah yeah yeah. So, that is important right, what am I trying to communicate? How do I make that message clear? And at a glance you cannot come back and say listen if you spend 25 minutes looking through the graph and looking at the axis and this and that and this and you will also get the same message, yeah. You should not have to use the magnifying glass to decipher the message exactly correctly. So, no fine print right yes. Then I always talk about sometimes the best way to communicate is just write a paragraph, yeah yeah. If that is the best way to get the message across please do so. There is nothing that says that you have to show it graphically, correct, yeah. Sometimes you know I use diagrams like a flow diagram or a you know workflow diagram and you know this is you know especially in factories you will always know how material flows and you know um or sometimes it would be a graph sometimes it could be a tabular display. So, you have to choose the form of the visual display that is best aligned to the message you are trying to communicate, yeah yeah. That linkage is important: you have a message and what is the visual representative form that unambiguously conveys the same message that I want to convey, yeah that is critical, correct. And then there is a set of design principles correct. And these design principles come into play to ensure that visual cognitive cognition is correct. Yes, do not confuse you and you know I will spend a lot of time on that as well because I think that is where people also go terribly wrong at times. Choosing the right form in my opinion is actually much easier because once you get a clear message the form almost suggests itself, yeah yeah yeah. But the design principle is what makes a difference. So, I am equal when I say that right I mean you know I am just trying to draw parallel to see what people might understand. I would go to the equivalent or you drive it through the offside because it is a nice half volley outside the half stump. The short that you play is natural; you do not try to hook that ball. You can drive it through half the side. Because it is a nice half volley through the half side so often marked once you get the message the form suggests itself naturally, correct, yes. Unless you are MS Dhoni you do not try to helicopter shot the ball over midwicket correctly if it is if the ball is outside the off stream you will hit it through the half side through the offside by and large it suggests itself, right uh. So, that is what we may say you know when you get the right message the form kind of suggests itself. But the design principles make a difference right and that is the difference between Rahul Marathe or Anand driving the ball through the covers and Virat Kohli driving the ball through the covers, yeah right yeah yeah and that is where the design principles come, right. People will pay money to see Virat Kohli do this and you know you and I will. I do not think people will watch it even if we pay money to do it. So, I think that is where the difference comes correct. So, we will just go through a few of those things exactly. So, let us focus on these three things a little bit more right, yeah okay. I think we have a few examples that we will talk about right precisely precisely, yes. This is okay this is where we can actually end this session and move on to the next session.
