Hello everyone welcome back. So, in this video we will try creating a dashboard from a simple dataset. So, for that first we will pick up a data set then we will create some visualization and finally we will make a dashboard all right. Let us start. this is a simple data set imagine you want to set up a call center. So, you have a history of incoming call volumes and you have a set of agents. So, in column A it is showing the timestamp on an hourly basis and in column B it tells us what is the number of incoming calls for the time for that every hour that means in a row between row 2 and rotary that is 8 a.m between 8.00 a.m and 9.00 a.m on first of January 2021 there were 40 number of calls which came to the call center. Similarly between 9.00 a.m and 10 a.m of 1st January 2021 there were 46 incoming calls and so on. Now these are the agents available for the time being ignore this column J just focus on the column F. So, we have 11 number of agents and we need to allocate these agents across three different shifts. So, that we can attend these calls effectively and we can improve our service level. Now what is service level that I will explain to you once we calculate it. Now what we intend to do, this is our task list. So, we want to show daily call records, then we want to show hourly calculators. We have we want to calculate what is the service level for these allocation of the agents then we will show the sensitivity analysis for the service level that means if we change the number of agents available how much service level is increasing. Now what we will do first is, we just copy this data set into another sheet see we create a copy. Then we will rename it as pre-process all right now for different time being we just delete these two columns. Now we have to find out for every month or every day or every hour how many columns were there sorry sorry. What we first do is we intend to find out how many incoming calls were there for every day every month or every hour. So, for that we will take this approach first we find the day then we will get the month then we will get a time slot where that is between 8 a.m to 9 a.m or 9 a.m to 10 a.m and so on. Then we will calculate for every month what is the total incoming call volume then we will calculate daily average. Then afterwards we will find the hourly average call volume to do that we first need to focus on column A with the timestamp. Now from this timestamp we will first extract what is the month then we will take out the day then we will take out the hour slot okay. So, for month we will use this excel function that you have learned in the course BDM. right all right Then we take up the day again actually this actual function we have used in the course BDM then we will take this hourly slot all right. Now we want to find out for every month what is the average number of calls that was incoming? So, we will make this like that who is the month number. So, we have in total how many months? We have just four months. So, we will get but we will just make four months 1, 2, 3, 4 then we will find out what month it is for example month number one means January. 'Text' in this cell multiplied by 28 then we want to find the form we want to populate with first three letters of every month. So, we will make the format as now here it is January then we will drag all right. Now we want to find out what was the total number of incoming calls for that month to do that we make some if range is month criteria is month number then we have sum ranges the call volumes. We want to find the total number of call volumes. Now this is the total number of calls for that month. Then we will drag it here. Now we want to find out the average number of calls to do that the month of January is 31st days and February is 28 days March is again 31 days April is 30 days. So, we will divide this thing by the total number of days okay this is divided by 28. This thing also you can you can search for an excel function I think that 31, 28 that month duration will be there in some excel function okay. Then I leave it to an exercise all right. Then make one more thing we will just because number of calls is a integer number okay. We will just change the format okay. Now you can find you can see that there is no much difference in the average number of calls per month. However we make a small visualization here itself to do that average number of calls insert pie chart on sorry bar chart then we will make it level okay. Then remember your x axis would start from zero, can you see the difference. Previously it was like there is a pattern like the the graphs the parts are ups and downs now it is almost saturated. Now we will change the colour okay then we will make average monthly calls monthly call volume then another thing important thing we need to add all the access titles. So, this is the month and the one more thing select data edit one name okay all right then also we will add the name of that vertical axis the axis name will be called volumes for better visualization I just rotate it as a horizontal one all right. So, we have created one visualization let us make it smaller for typing. Now we will do the same exercise for every hour that means we want to find out what is the average number of incoming calls for every time slot. So to do that so we have total how many how many calls hour slot is there unique hour slot we have from 8 till 20. So, we will make it here. I will drag it till 20. Now we want to find sum of call I can use the same function 'sum if' this is one criteria is this one then we want to find the total call values. So, we select column B all right. So, I will drag to 20. Now to make the average we are going to find out. So, how many times this our slots are available in this data set. So, count our slot I will simply make it as hash, hash means count then we will do the count if, count if our slot we want to count how many of these things are there. So, everywhere 120 now we can find average hourly calls this is equal to sum of call divided by total number of hour slots that is repeating in the data set. We will make it around because number of pulses in desired. Now you can see there is a specific pattern to that between 8 am till 11 am the hourly incoming calls is 45. However from 12 pm onwards the incoming calls surged up that is from 95 it reached 90 plus then again from 4 pm it is 30 it is 100 it has another 100 in between digital there is a slump at 3 pm and at 8 pm. So, we will make a visualization for this as the same I will select this we will create a bar chart all right. We will make the data labels then we will change the horizontal axis select data all right here this x is starting from zero. So, no problem then we will make we will name the x's this is our slot then in the y-axis we have the call volumes I can will make it horizontal all right now we will change the look similar to the previous one okay. So, again it will minimize this all right. So, we have analyzed the hourly and monthly incoming call volumes. Now we will go for allocation of agents. So, now have we have to allocate that 11 agents available to us across three different shifts. So, the call center works from 8 a.m sorry 8 a.m till 8 pm. So, 12 hours. So, three shifts have been allocated for this entire duration. So, we assume that some of the agents join at 8 00 am some join at 10 a.m and another people set of people join at 12 p.m and every agents work for 8 hours. So, we will see shift starting. Let us assume three people join at 8 am four join at 10 am and another four start from 12 p.m. So, total we have 11 people another parameter we need is what is the average number of call duration? Say on an average every call takes around 5 minutes. So, average call duration that is five minutes in that case for one agent can attend maximum 12 calls in one hour. So, that is as in the individual agent's capacity, this is equal to 60 minute divided by 5 minute which is 12. Now here just remember one thing every agent works for 8 hours that means the agents who will who has joined the 8 am shift will be working till 4 pm. Similarly the agents which have started at 10 am will work till 6 pm and similarly those joining at 12 pm will work till 8 pm. Now we have to find out for every hour slot how many agents are available? For example suppose the people who have joined at 8 am another set of agents will join at 10 am. So, in that case total capacity will be three plus four which is equal to seven. So, here we will make a matrix out of that agents joining at 8 okay. So, before that we want to find out for every slot how many agents have joined. So, hourly slot again this is this hour slot all right. Now in every hour slot there will be some people who will join it start from 8 some will we have started from 10 am and there will be some people who study from 12 pm we want to find out what is the total number of agents available First we find out whether the agents who are working where started at 8 am will be available in all this slot. now we have to find out how many agents will be available in each slot to do that remember suppose at 8 am for every slot we have to find out how many people who have joined at 8 am will be there and whether those 10 am shift people will be available or at 12 pm people also will be available. First we will find out whether the 8 am shift people will be available in all this slot they will be available from 8 to 16 that is 4 pm. So, we will make people from 8 am shift okay. So, here if if starting time is 8 and ending time is 16 this people will be available. So, we will make if our slot is greater than equal to the starting point and we will make this end here and hourly slot is less than equal to another 8 hours. Then these people will be available sorry 3 agents will be available otherwise no. I will drag it. you see. Similarly we have to find out whether 10 am shift people also will be available in this all this hourly slot. So, people from 10 am shift now people form 12 pm shift. So, again we will make like this we will copy the formula all right. So, they will start from 10 am and work till 6 pm and here also will the same will make it 11 we will make it 11 cell number eleven. okay all right. So, these four people will be available from 12 pm till 8 pm. Now what is the total number of people available total agents available in every hourly slot. So, this is equal to sum of this three now this means at 8 am three agents will be available 9 am 3 agents will be available 10 am 7 people will be available and so on. Now every agent can attend maximum 12 calls in one hour. So, what is the available capacity in each hour this is equal to total number of agents available and hourly capacity of one agent, this is this one. okay yeah Now we will find out in this if we follow this distribution then what will be our service level? Service level is what is the percentage of incoming calls which were attended. Now we will copy these two cells first is these are hourly call volumes. You can see our liquid volumes then we will copy paste it here then what is the what is the hourly slot this column I will copy paste it here again. Now what we will do this is our demand this is our slot we want to find out what is the available capacity from this metric. Now for available capacity we will make the vlookup. We are looking up this value in this entire matrix then we want to find out this one this column, column s that is 1 2 3 4 5th column that is 5 and it should be exact match all right. Now we will drag sorry it should be 6th 6th column. Now we have to find out what is the number of calls unattended that is if we have capacity more than the demand then we have zero calls unattended otherwise the difference between the demand and the capacity. So, count calls number of calls unattended is the max of this available minus capacity and zero sorry it should be max of demand minus capacity or zero. That means in this 8 hour slot on that day four calls were added because there were 40 incoming calls but we have capacity to attend only 36 calls. So, received four is unattended call yeah. So, this is your metric now to find out what is the service level? Now, the service level is defined by the number of calls from the total incoming calls which were attended to do that is scheduled as and total call attended total call minus the total call unattended that is the sum of this one minus sum of unattended calls divided by divided by again total number of calls multiplied by 100. This is my service level that means 94% of the incoming calls were attended. Now we can actually vary these numbers and you can see how our call volumes are improving or changing. So, what we will do we will just copy this one to here we will make it as the allocation one will check one two more allocations by changing the number of people available. And also we will make a location ah one two three and what is the service level for the location. So, here it is 94.97 now we will make the location we add one more guy in 8 am shift. We can see that it has increased to 96 percentage. Now you can you have one observation for unattended you can see between 8 am till 6 pm there is no backlogs, backlogs are available only at 7 pm. Now we will add one more person now we will add one more agent in shift one make it five then it has become ninety seven percent service level. So, application is 4, 4, 4 here 5, 4, 4. Now we will plot this service level. This is our sensitivity this means by adding one more agent how my service level is changing. Now we will add again text titles and we will make it horizontal. Now we will create a dashboard. So, we have created all the visualizations required for our dashboard. Now we will actually collect all this information into one place to make it one dashboard. So, we create a new shared dashboard new because I already have another sheet called dashboard here first we will make a background we will create a background we will make it in this colour. Then from the preprocess steps all this bar charts we will copy to this sheet. okay okay The average first we will take the average monthly call volume then we will take average hourly call volumes Then we need the data for this bar chart because that is important because what are the allocations we have taken for calculating the service level that information we need to bring. So, we will copy this information paste it here and then we will make we will wrap these cells thereafter we will make it the table all right. Then we will remove these filters from the table now we can change the design also. But right now I just I will just make it a picture. So, that I can pull these data into this dashboard. So, what I will do I will select this one ctrl c for copy and control v for paste thing now paste is picture. Now this is a picture now I will drag this to my dashboard. Now I will set this here this picture here now uh the viewer can refer to these table to interpret this service level table. So, we will make one we have forgot to put the chart title. Now I will give a title to this entire dashboard. Again we will copy will include one sheet, we will make suppose a call center dashboard. Now we will change this colour we change the color to something pleasant no this is not the good all right. So, this is our dashboard hope you like this dashboard it is a very simple one. And you might include some a lot of more information you can put some slicers some drop down menus and so on. Suppose if you want to make it an interactive one then support then here you can suppose this one average call volume duration this is a user parameter you can give a provision for the user to change this data. So, suppose if you are if I am working on python or something on power Bi then you can make is a user interaction field. You can also search in excel it can be done. So, nevertheless this is a simple dashboard it will have all our relevant information that we are seeking. You can also try once I will share this excel sheet with you on the portal and you can also try you can download some simple data and try to create some dashboard and you can also search for standard dashboards over internet. So, thank you very much.
