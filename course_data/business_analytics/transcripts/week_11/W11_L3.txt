Welcome back to the new session on conjoint analysis. This time we are going to take a statistical approach in particular a linear regression approach. Just to recall the last session was on taking an optimization approach to solve the conjoint analysis problem. What were the specific details of that optimization problem? I remember, we had that example of five products, which were detailed on two attributes, and remember that the attribute values were almost continuous remember, we had values like 1.5, 2.3 that kind of thing. So, in the optimization approach, the attribute data, the product property data, you can say, product features data was almost continuous the consumer choice data, if you recall, the consumer choice data was pairwise we asked the consumer between the pair j, k What do you prefer and we recorded the ordered pair j, k. These are some of the things that we are going to change and look at the statistical approach. So, if you have, so, what does that mean to a manager? If you have the product data on a continuous scale and you are you have collected consumer choice data only in a pairwise approach, you should go with the optimization method that we had seen in the previous session. On the other hand, if your data on the product properties, if your data on the product dimensions are categorical, and you have collected only the preference ranking data, you have collected only the preference ranking data, which means that you had five products product variant, product variant 1, product variant 2, product variant 3, product variant 4, and product variant 5, you did not ask the consumer to give their preferences pairwise, you only said out of these five products rank them, rank them, rank them. And then, the consumer said what, looking at all the product dimensions, product number 4, I will rank number 1, product number 2, I will rank number 2, product number 3, I will rank number 3, this is 4 for me and this is 5 for me. So, the consumer is ranking the product or the consumer is rating the product I will explain, what is the difference. So, I will say this is 10 on 10 for me, probably this is 8 for me, this is 7 for me, this is 5 for me and this is 3 for me. So, when the consumer is ranking the consumer is ranking products obviously, a smaller number means a better product. On the other hand, when the consumer is rating the product, we are generally going to say that the higher the rate, the higher the rating, 10 on 10 on a scale of 10, I am giving the product a 10 which means the product is 10 and 10 for me, so the higher the rating the better the product is. After a, after 10 is 8. So, 8 is the next preferred product. So, the consumer choice data is also not collected pair-wise. Consumer choice data is collected for the ratings. So let us go with ratings because we can always convert ranking to a rating, we can always do that. So let us not do this also, let us do this. So when is the linear programming, and when is the linear programming approach used? The linear programming approach is used when the consumer choice data is pair-wise data and the attribute values are continuous. The linear regression approach is going to be used when the consumer choice data is ratings. And the product attribute data is categorical. Need not always be categorical but essentially we want the consumer choice data to be on a rating scale. We do not want pair-wise comparisons when we are trying to use regression. It so, happens that this is the most traditional method of running conjoint analysis. And it is just a multiple linear regression, and we have seen multiple linear regression. So really, this session is not going to be about describing the multiple regression output, even though there are some tweaks to the multiple regression model, but the focus is not on regression. The focus is trying to get insights into our conjoint analysis that has been run through the regression problem. So for the regression problem, we are going to say that the consumer rating data is my dependent variable this is my y this is, this is the response variable. So, the consumer essentially responds to a whole bunch of attribute values and gives me a rating. So, the rating value is the dependent variable. So, rating values are the dependent variable and all the attribute data. Characteristics on the product which is attribute data are all my independent predictor variable explanatory variables. Once again let us not get into the debate of whether I should be calling that independent variable because sometimes they are not independent they have correlation and we have seen what happens, multicollinearity, and all that we have seen. So, let us say that they are explanatory variables. So, attribute data is the explanatory variable, and the customers rating data respondent we are going to call that customer a respondent because they are the ones who are responding to our choices options. So, that is going to be the dependent variable. So, here are the betas, the regression coefficients have a special interpretation, we are going to call them utilities, we are going to call them path worth, sorry, part-worth, part-worth, we will come to that. A couple of slides down the line, we are going to talk about part-worth. So, we are going to focus on the interpretation of the regression coefficients which are the betas for this regression model. So, pay attention to that. So, let us we are going to check whether the regression itself is significant or not using our typical indicators, R squared is going to help us, the P values are going to help us with the squared error, the standard error is going to help us, RMSE is going to help us so, all those are typical indicators of whether the regression itself is good or not will be checked, but the focus is going to be on this beta, the focus is going to be on this beta because that gives me a very important piece of information which is called part worths or part utilities. So, let us look at the insight. So, what example do we have? I have constructed. So, this is a completely hypothetical example, I have constructed this example. This is not from any textbook; this is not from any one of the online resources. And most importantly, this is not a survey that was conducted. This was the simple hypothetical example that was created for this session. So, I have an example of a cell phone and the choices for cell phones. So, what kind of things do we look at when we buy a cell phone when we buy a mobile phone? Typically I look at a brand, such as the manufacturer of Samsung, Xiaomi, iPhone, and so on, OnePlus. I may be I may want my cell phone to last longer therefore, I may be interested in the powerful battery. Today is a world of selfies. So, probably I am interested in having a very good front camera. So camera resolution is important that too front camera resolution is important. I am talking about the selfie generation, there may be many other attributes, but I have looked at these three, I have looked at these three. So, the hypothetical example that we are going to show now has data on choices for the brand, choices for battery sizes, and various front camera resolutions. So, in particular, we have considered three brands, three brands we choose from, two battery options, and three choices for camera resolution. And for that, I looked at the cell phone data, and cell phone sales data in India and for my hypothetical example, I selected some of the better selling mobile brands in India. The same is true for battery options, I have tried to choose the popular battery options and I have tried to choose popular front camera resolution options. So, what is going to happen in a conjoint analysis? So how many choices are there? There are three brands multiplied by 2 battery options multiplied by 3 camera resolutions. So 18 options that you can build, 18 options that you can build by permutation and combinations of these attributes. We are going to show all 18 attributes remember, for the optimization problem, we said how many choices exist, we said n into n minus 1 divided by 2, so there are five products, there are five products, we were asking the consumer for pairwise choices. Therefore, we had to ask consumers n into n minus 1 divided by 2, so five, for five products, so 5 into 4 divided by 2. So, we had to ask consumers 10 choices. Here, we are going to ask consumers to choose or rate or rank 18 options this was a 10 pairwise comparison, this is 18 direct ratings to be provided, 18 direct ratings to be provided, that was for only 5 products using these combinations you can construct 18 products, you can construct 18 products that the consumer has to provide a rating for. There, there were only 5 products that had values on two attributes. So, 10 pairwise choices questions. Do you prefer this or this? Do you prefer this or this? Do you prefer this or this? We asked that question 10 times, here we are directly going to show the product and how many products 18 different products were constructed out of three brands, two options of battery, and three choices of camera resolution, I will show the data in a minute. So, we are going to consider what is called a full factorial design. In a full factorial design, the consumer gets to see all the possible combinations, all the possible combinations and then they have to provide as we decided they are not going to provide rank they are going to provide ratings. But we know that there is a, there is a strong association, if I know the rank, I can ask the consumers to give me a rating on a 10 scale or something like that. The lower value of rank means the most preferred product higher value of rating means the more preferred product. And obviously, as we decided we are going to go with ratings. So let us look at Excel. Let us look at the Excel, stopping the PPT now and showing the Excel. So, this is the data, this is the data. So these are the options as I said there are 18 options, there are 18 options constructed from three choices of brands, what are the brands that we have selected? Samsung, Vivo, and Xiaomi are the three brands available. There are two battery sizes 4500 mAh batteries usually in mAH that is the unit, mAh. So 4500 is one choice 6000 is the other choice. So, there are two choices for batteries, two choices for batteries. And there are three choices for the front camera resolution 20 MP, 13 MP, and 8 MP, 20 megapixels, 13 megapixels, and 8 megapixels. So, fairly powerful front cameras. And I do not know whether these combinations exist in the market I have constructed them I told you this is a hypothetical example. And therefore using combinations of these options I can create 18 different products. So, Samsung with 4500 mAh battery and 20 MP camera is my option number 1, Samsung with 4500 mAh battery and 13 MP camera is option number 2, and so on and so on. Xiaomi there are three choices, there are three models of Xiaomi with 4500 mAh battery, there are three choices, three options of Xiaomi with 6000 mAh battery, there are two options for, not Xiaomi, Vivo there are three options of Vivo with the 4500 mAh battery, there are three options of Vivo with 4500 mAh batteries, similarly for Xiaomi. There are two options of Vivo with 20 MP camera this is one option 20 MP camera which has 4500 mAh battery, 20 MP camera which has 6000 mAh battery, so two options for 20 MP camera, two options for 13 MP camera which is this 4500 and the 6000 for Vivo. So, accordingly, there will be products, and product options created. So, this is the data that I show the consumer, this is the data that I show the consumer, I show them, I show this consumer options for 18 products, and I ask the consumer give me your rating, give me your rating. So clearly, the consumer says that Samsung with a 4500 mAh battery and a 20 MP camera are the preference rating. So this is rating, this is rating value. The rating means on a scale of 10. This is a scale, this is a scale of 10, let us write that also, on a scale of 10. And obviously, the higher the rating, the more preference for that particular product, the more preference for that particular product. So, two products have received 10 on 10 ratings. One is this product. So consumer says option number 10 which is a Vivo cell phone with 6000 mAh battery and 20 MP camera. Also, Xiaomi with a 6000 mAh battery and 20 MP camera was rated 10 on 10 by the consumer. There are other ratings also what is the next rating 9, 9 was the next highest rating, Samsung 6000 mAh battery, and 20 MP camera. These are the typical choices we want a more powerful battery, we want an amazing front camera. So, the ratings for higher resolution for a camera are going to get higher ratings. So, similarly, 7 consumer rates Vivo which has a 4500 mAh battery on a 20 MP, front camera resolution is rated, rated as 7 out of 10. There are lots of 7 though, a lot of 7 s. Xiaomi with 16, 6000 mAh battery and 13 MP camera was also rated 7, Xiaomi with a 4500 mAh battery and 20 MP camera was also rated 7, these are all ratings provided by the consumer, ratings provided by the consumer. People do not like bad or low-resolution cameras and see weaker batteries. So, Vivo with a 4500 mAh battery and 8 MP camera was rated only 2 out of 10, this was even worse Samsung with a 4500 mAh battery and 8 MP camera was rated only 1. So, this is a rating on a scale of 10. So, this is my response data this is what the consumer responded with for the 18 choices that I provided to the consumer. So, this is going to be coded as my response variable, the y variable. These are going to be my explanatory variable but look at this. Here, explanatory variables are categorical variables, they are not continuous variables, and they are not like the 1.5 and 2.3 that we had on the attribute values when we looked at the optimization problem. So, this is categorical data I mean here you cannot even rank the brands, you may want to arrange the batteries either as 4500 first or 6000 first. Similarly, for different camera resolutions the way I have done. Either go from top to bottom in terms of number, in terms of pixels available, or go from bottom to top in terms of pixels available. So, whichever way you look at it, this data is categorical data, which means that I will have to code it before I built a regression model out of it. So, let us explain that coding. So, what we are going to do is let us code the data, let us put some numbers there because I really cannot run a regression with names like Samsung here, if I run the regression with 4500 and 6000, the regression is going to treat this as a continuous variable, however, it is not. Similarly, for the front camera, we do not want it that way. So, let us say that Samsung is going to be called brand number 1, Vivo is going to be called brand number 2 and Xiaomi is going to be called brand number 3. So, one way of putting a number there. We are going to call 4500 mAh battery as number 1, 6000 mAh battery as number 2, and so on. So, 4000, whenever you, whenever you see 1, 1 here that means 4500. Whenever you see 2 here that means a 6000 mAh battery. Similarly, the last piece of coding is for front camera resolution, let us put 20 MP as number 1, 13 MP as number 2, and 8 MP as number 3. Corresponding to these three values. And, preference data hopefully is not changed at all it is the same that that is the response provided by the consumer, I am only trying to pull the input data. Let us define variables that should go into the regression model let us get. So now, I am defining binary variables. This kind of definition still does not help me, we are not going to go with Samsung recorded as 1 and Vivo recorded as 2, let us not do that. Because that is still confusing. Let us define a binary variable for brands. So, I am going to define three binary variables for a brand. X, X1 takes on a value of 1 or 0, X1 is 1 if the brand is Samsung. So, how do you define, how do you define X1? Let us go here let us add an Excel sheet, let us add a blank sheet. How do you define, how do you define X1? So X1, X1 is equal to 1 if the brand is equal to Samsung, is equal to 0 otherwise. How do you define X2? X2 is 1 if the brand is Vivo and 0 otherwise. X3 is 1 if the brand is Xiaomi and 0 otherwise. So, this is how I define a binary variable 1 for each brand. So, I get three variables just for the brand attribute. Similarly, I will define X4 as equal to 1 if battery size, battery size, spelling is incorrect battery size is 4500 mAh and 0 otherwise. So, by the way, X5 will be 1 or 0, 1 if the battery, battery size, and battery size is 6000 mAh, 0 otherwise. So, that is how we will keep defining the binary variables and these binary variables will now be used in the regression equation. Now, this is something different from what we had looked at in the regression models that we had seen earlier. So, as I said three binary variables one for each brand. So, X1 is 1 if the brand is Samsung, X2 is 1 if the brand is Vivo and X3 is 1, and X3 is 1 when the brand is Xiaomi. You have to ensure that you do not have two 1 s in these rows, there is only one 1 here, there is only one 1 which is for column number D which corresponds to Vivo. Here, there is only one 1 in each row, corresponding to row E which corresponds to Xiaomi. So, binary variable 1 for each brand. Similarly, binary variable 1 for each battery size. So, X4 is equal to 1, when the battery size is 4500 mAh, X4 is 1 if the battery size is 4500 mAh, it is 0 otherwise. Clearly, in this case, X4 is 0 which means the battery size is not 4500. So, what is it? It is defined by X5, X5, X5 is 1 when battery size is 6000, 0 otherwise, 0 otherwise. So, these are the two variables, these are the two binary variables that we defined for battery size. And again these are the three variables that we get to define, 1 for each front camera resolution. So, if the front camera resolution is 20 MP, X6 is equal to 1. X6, X6 is equal to 1 if the front camera resolution is 20 MP here, 20 MP here, 20 MP here. So, 1, 1 was quoted as 20 MP, 2 was quoted as 13 MP, 3 was quoted as 8 MP. So, wherever you see 1 here, X6 should be 1, X6 is 1 when you have 1 here, you have 1 here. So, X6 should be 1. When you have a battery, when you have a front camera, which is not 20 MP, X6 will be 0, where X6 is 0 because the front camera resolution is number 2, number 2 is 13 MP here, X6 is 0 because the front camera resolution is quoted 3. What is 3? 3 means 8 MP. So, X7 is defined exactly for 13 MP, X7 is 1 when the front camera resolution is 13 MP. So, there is a 1 here, there is a 1 here, there is a 1 here, there is a 1 here, and so on. And we have done that kind of coding for all the 18 product options that we have shown to the consumer. Hopefully, this variable now, what we have done, we have defined the variables that we are going to use in our regression model X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 we have, we have defined these variables. Let us remove this we do not need this kind of coding now, 1 2 3, we are not going to use 1 2 3 codings, we are not going to use 1 2 codings, we are not going to use this 1 2 3 coding for brands. So, let us remove that and keep the coding. So, now I have removed that. So, now I have only variables. Hopefully, that goes into my regression equation X1, X2, and X3 is for the brand, these are for the brand, X4 and X5 are for battery, and X6, X7, and X8 are for front camera resolution. In all this, I have not touched the preference data because preference data comes from the consumer. What I am playing with right now trying to quote my attribute levels using binary variables. Now you see a problem here. What is the problem here? What do you, what do you not want in multiple linear regression? We had discussed earlier when we discussed another application of multiple linear regression. We do not want multicollinearity. What is the situation of multicollinearity? When does multicollinearity happen? When the explanatory variables are correlated. Now, do you see a correlation among the explanatory variables? Can you notice a correlation amongst the explanatory variables? Let me tell you that, if I tell you that X2 is 0, X3 is 0. If I tell you that X2 is 0, X3 is 0. What am I telling you? I am telling you that X2 is 0. What does that mean? X2 is 0 which means your brand is not Vivo, X3 is also 0. What does that mean? If X3 is 0, that the brand is not Xiaomi. So, what do we mean by this? Not Vivo, not Xiaomi. Essentially, that means it is, it has to be Samsung. So, if I tell you the value of these two variables, if I tell you the values of X2 and X3, you can tell me that X1 will be 1. So there is a strong correlation. Essentially, that is what it means. If these three variables were independent, the values of X1 should not have any bearing on the value of X2 should not have any bearing on the value of X3. Here I am telling you if X2 is 0, X3 is 0, you can say 100 percent, and X1 is 1 because there are only three brands. So, if the, if the brand that you are showing to the consumer is not Vivo X2, is 0, not Xiaomi, it has to be Samsung. So X1 will be 1. So, you cannot have that, remember that. This is even more pronounced, this is even more pronounced, here X1, X4 is 1, X4 is 1, X4 is 1 means that the battery size is 4000 mAh look battery capacity, we have been calling that size it is not size, it is battery capacity. The battery capacity is 4500 mAh, if I tell you that X4 is equal to 1, X4 is equal to 1 means the battery capacity is 4500 mAh. You know that X5 is going to be 0, you cannot have X4 be equal to 1 and X5 be equal to 1 at the same time. Battery capacity cannot be 4500 mAh and 6000 mAh at the same time. So knowing the value of one explanatory variable, you can tell me the value of the other explanatory variable, you do not want this situation, you do not want this situation. Whatever happened for X1, X2, X3 is going to happen for X6, X7, and X8. If I tell you that X7 is 0 and X8 is 0, the moment you know X7 is 0, you know that the front camera resolution is not 13 MP, if you know X8 is 0, you know that the front camera resolution is not 8 MP, so not 13 MP, not 8 MP. Essentially means that the front camera resolution is 20 MP because you know that there are only three options. If it is not 13, not 8 it essentially means it is 20. So, knowing the value of the two explanatory variables tells you completely about the third variable here amongst these three variables X6, X7, X8 this is a strong indication of collinearity, a very strong indication of collinearity which is not correct in a multiple linear regression model. So, what do we do? How can we remove this multicollinearity from our regression model? What we are going to do is from each of these groups, the first group is X1, X2, and X3 because it represents the brand, the second group is X4 and X5 because it represents battery capacity the third group is X6, X7, X8 which represents front camera resolution. From each of these groups, we are going to remove one of the variables. So, let us say from here we remove X1, let us highlight that, we will remove this X1. From this, we will remove X4, let us remove X6 or let us remove X8, or let us remove X8. So I have removed one variable from each of the groups. Does that affect my output of the multiple linear regression? We are going to, later on, show that it does not. However, it does help me, it does help me because since X1 is not in the regression equation, now there are only two, now there are only two. Now, when X2 is 0, it is not necessary that X3 has to be 1, X2 is 0, X3 can be 0, X3 can be 1, and X3 can be 1. So, when X2 is 0 and X2 is 0, I have no automatic choice that X3 has to take a particular value, X3 could be 0, and X2 can be 1 or 0. X2, look at this all these values, all these values, look at these values, look at this. X3 is 0, X2 can be 1 which has, which happens in all these cases or X2 can be 0 also. So, whatever we can say about X2, we can say that about X3. So, knowing the value of X2 does not automatically tell me anything about X3. So, we have removed that collinearity we are removed that collinearity. Now, X2 is 0, X3 can be 0 or X3 can be 1. Similarly, when X3 is 0, X1, sorry X2 can be 1 or X2 can be 0 also. Similarly, X5 is 0, X5 is 0 there is an only a single variable, X5 is 0, X5 is 1, but we know we can interpret when X5 is 0, we know that X4 is 1, but X4 is not going to be explicitly included in the model. So, similarly, X8 we have removed X8. Now, when X6 is 0 when X6 is 0, X7 need not always be 0, X7 can be 1, but there are cases where X6 is 0, let me find that case X6 is 0, but X7 is also 0. So, knowing the value of X6, knowing the value that X6 is 0 does not automatically tell me that X7 is 1 or 0. X6 could be 0, X7 could be 1 or 0, and vice versa. So, we have removed that very strong association amongst the explanatory variables. Now, let us spend a very brief moment on the variable that was removed. We have removed essentially the brand Samsung, the battery size 4500, and the 8 MP camera. And the reason was, this was fair, we could have removed Vivo and we could have removed Xiaomi also. But this becomes the base value, this becomes the base value, and this becomes the base value. And therefore, when we talk about betas we are going to highlight that for these three attribute levels Samsung 4500 mAh battery and 8 MP camera this attribute level is going to be coded as giving a utility of 0. So, this becomes the base utility and you calculate other utilities only as a deviation from this utility. So, in that sense, you do not get the direct utility values you only get the relative utility values, where Samsung is quoted as utility 0 and Vivo s utility is going to be as is going to be quantified as a utility from Samsung, and the other way around. So, let us remove this and this becomes my final coding. So, I have removed X1 from here I have remote X4 from here, and I have removed X8 from here. The reason for removing X8 and not X6. We could have removed X6 also, that would not have made any difference to our regression equation. The reason for removing X8 and not X6 was, that this was a lower sized camera resolution and in general, it is expected that consumers would prefer a higher resolution camera, a higher resolution front camera. Therefore, what we have essentially removed is can be inconsistent, we removed the lower size, lower capacity battery, so we removed the lower resolution camera, but the results would not have changed that much, the interpretation of results would not have changed even if we had removed X6 instead of X8, but this is my final values now. I have removed X1, I have removed X4 and I have removed X8. So this is my final coding and this is the final data that I am going to use for my regression model. In all this, please note that I was only playing with a binary variable I have not touched the preference data. Preference data comes from the old sheet where the actual data was collected from the consumer on the 18 options. That data is still intact when I am trying to run the regression now.
