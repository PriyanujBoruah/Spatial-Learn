So, I hope that the problem formulation is okay now, the problem formulation is okay now the setup is okay we have still not formulated the problem. So, we have simply written the constraints, and so on the next step is going to data going to the solver and solving the problem right actually solving the problem. What do I do? Let me formulate the, I already formulated the problem so do I show you do delete all that? Yeah sure. Why not? I will show you. Sure. Let me go to solver I will reset everything I will reset everything up blanked out. Where is my objective function set object your objective function here, this is my objective function, it is a minimization object by changing what, what are my decision variables? My decision variables are all here, where are my decision variables? These are all my decision variables, before I come to that, let us do this properly, let us also delete these values so that the problem is not already solved. So, let us ask Excel to start with a blank. The objective function is 0, then I will go to the solver, the objective is this. Minimization objective by changing what, these are my decision variables? What are my decision variables? My decision variables are w's, v s, and z's. These are the decision variables I have nicely already put them in the same row so that I can nicely select them easily. So, these are my decision variables from here w1, I am selecting w1, then selecting w2, v1, v2, z, all the z variables, they are my decision variables. That is all, these are my decision variables. Now, what are the constraints, all my constraints, all my constraints are here, these are the left- hand side of the constraints, notice that these are the left-hand side of the constraints, these greater than or equal to constraints 10 of them have to be greater than or equal to zeros. So, the right-hand side is all zeros. And what is the next constraint is this last constraint within the equality constraint, equality constraint and this has to be equal to this, add. Now, what else do we want? Now, let me put a cancel here. Are we done with the formulation? Unfortunately, not. Let us look at this. We want the w variables to be greater than or equal to 0. We want the z variables to be greater than or equal to 0. But we do not want v variables to have any kind of restrictions. We want them to be unrestricted, how do you do that? So, go to add variables, where are my w variables, my w variables are here, these are my w variables make them greater than or equal to 0. So greater than or equal to 0 add them. z these are all my z variables, make them also greater than or equal to 0, I am making them explicitly greater or equal to 0, I am not doing anything for me. So, I am telling Excel, I do not care, I will remove this checkbox also, this checkbox tells the Excel that make all the decision variables non-negative, I do not want that, I do not want the v variables to have non-negative I want them to be unrestricted. I have explicitly made the w variables greater than or equal to 0, I have made all the z variables explicitly greater than or equal to 0 and I have not said that all the decision variables should be greater than or equal to 0 which means that v can be unrestricted. Now, if I hit the solve button, hopefully, I will get the same answer that I had originally put up there. All the constraints are satisfied we got the same answer that was originally there on the Excel sheet. So, I have not goofed up anywhere. So, the problem is solved optimally. Now, let us understand what this means. Let us understand what this means. First of all important variables. Now, what are the optimal values of the weights? So, why by this formulation, what did we want to get? We wanted to understand what is the weightage what is the importance given by this consumer to each of the attributes attribute 1 attribute 2. Consumer looked at the attribute values, then consumer said these are my choices. So, from these choices, we want to understand how much was the weightage How much was the importance given by this consumer for each of the attributes and the values are 0.006 And 0.009. Now, in isolation, they do not mean anything, I mean, what do you mean by 0.006 and 0.009. Do not look at it this way, look at it this way, if I take this right 0.009 divided by 0.006 I get 1.46. So, essentially what we mean is our consumer 2 provided more weightage to attribute 2 when she provided the choices, she was allocating higher weightage, almost 1.46 times the weightage that she had assigned for attribute 1. So, what does that tell you? Now, what is the input? What do we understand what does what do these values tell us? These values tell us that attribute 2 is more important 46 percent more important than attribute 1. So, all the product designers pay attention to focus on attribute 2 and getting it right, make sure that you get attribute 2 right, because the consumer is looking at attribute 2 more than they are looking at attribute 1 this is what we mean by the values of w variables. Now, let us interpret the values of the v variables. Remember v was a variable that we had defined that was not originally in the equation, v was defined as w into p or w into x. And what had we said at that time, we had said v what was the original objective not only one of the objectives of solving the optimization problem was to understand which attributes a consumer is giving more importance to but the other thing was how do I get my ideal product. Now, my ideal product was x, if you recall, if you go back to this formulation, the ideal point, the ideal point of the consumer was x. So, I want to get the coordinates of x. Now, we said we will define a variable called v and from that v we will get the value of x. So, this is what we said. How do we get the x values we get the x values from the w values and the v values. So, v is equal to w into x. So, what is that x? x is v divided by w. So, how do I use the v variables, v variables are used not in isolation, but v variables helped me calculate the ideal coordinates of my attributes. So, let us go to the data, these are the v values. Remember, v values were unrestricted, we allowed v to take on any value any value in the sense of negative value, positive value 0. Why did we allow that? Because the ideal coordinates need not always fall in the first quadrant, ideal coordinates may fall in the negative quadrant, with either a negative value of x or a negative value of y. So, we wanted to allow that therefore, we allowed the v, we allowed the v to be unrestricted, we allowed the v to be unrestricted, v was unrestricted, even in the formulation we did not impose a constraint that v has to be greater than or equal to 0. So, therefore, we can take on v s v1 and v2 attribute 1 and attribute 2 we can take on any values. Coincidentally both of them turned out to be positive in our optimal solution does not guarantee that it will always happen. Now, how do I use this v value, x1 is calculated as v1 divided by w1, and x1 is calculated as v1 divided by w1. Similarly, x2 is calculated as v2 divided by w2, that is how we are going to use the v values. We are going to these v's are going to give us the ideal coordinates. So, how have the v variables helped us v variables have helped us calculate the optimal coordinates of my product. So, if I was a market researcher or a product designer, want to offer a product that will be most preferred by the consumer by a consumer. If I want to design a product, which will be most preferred by this consumer, the attribute 1 value should be 5.63 the attribute 2 value should be 6.67 these are all the values that are present in the five variants that are currently available to the market, currently available to the consumers, none of them are even close to the ideal point, none of them have values of attribute 1 close to 5.63. None of them have an attribute 2 value that is close to 6.67 this optimization problem is telling me that the ideal value for attribute 1 is 5.63 the ideal value of attribute 2 is 6.67. So, once again a job for the product developers product developer should design a product where the attribute 1 value is 5.63 and attribute 2 value is 6.67. Now, as we have discussed attribute one and attribute two could be anything we need not even say that the product should always have two attributes. This is a generic formulation, we have shown a formulation where there are only two attributes because we have data for two attributes, the formulation is generic enough that we can solve for any number of attributes, but this is what I this is very important information for me I directly get inputs for my product design. Now, I need to target this value attribute 1 and this value of attribute 2. So, we have explained w1 and w2 to the importance attached by this consumer for each of the attributes v1 and v2 mostly used in calculating the coordinates of the ideal point. Now, let us understand the z values, z values in some sense represent the violation of the pairwise choices provided by the consumer. z values in some ways represent the violation of the pairwise choices given by the consumer. Now, the v value the optimal objective function value of 2. 0.25 comes from this z value, which is z12, z12 turns out to be 0.25. Now, what is the z, z represents the violation z represents the violation. Ideally, I want all the violations to be 0. So, ideally, I want the objective function value to be 0. Unfortunately, it is not. So, what are we saying? If, if we assume that the consumer had assigned a weight of 0.006 for attribute 1 had assumed weight of 009 for attribute 2, then all the pairs of choices will be correct. All the pairs of choices will be correct. However, choice 1 2 is violated, what are the pairwise choice 1 2 that is violated. So, what are we saying we are saying that if the consumer had these weights in mind, this pairwise choice is violated consumer would have ideally preferred 2 over 1, but the consumer has given me data that she prefers 1 over 2. So, this is in some ways, not desirable. Ideally, I wanted none of the pairwise choices given by the consumer to be violated. But here, it is the violation is minimal. Only 1 out of the 10 pairs the choices were violated. But this is the indirect way of measuring how good my fit is, remember we said what was the objective of this formulation? The objective of this formulation was to look at its badness or, Poorness of it. The objective function was the poorness of it, how poor is my fit. When I, what is my fit? My Fit is calculating the w values, calculating the w values, and x values. These are this is the fit that I am suggesting from the data from the choice data. So, is my fit correct? So, I am saying well, the fit is not perfectly correct. If I use these weights now, one pair of choices gets violated. So, how is this linear programming model fitting to the data? How is the linear programming model fitting to the data? Well, it is not perfect, but it is not bad either. Only one of the 10 pairs is violated. So, that is what this objective function value means. So, with that, hopefully, we have explained everything in the formulation, everything in the formulation. Once again, this formulation is generic. I have taken an example where there are only five product variants, and two attribute data, actually paying homage to the original article, that article also had 5 variants and 2 attribute data, but obviously, I wanted to play around with the attribute values in that article, they have used different values of the attributes, I have used this 1.5 and 12 and so on. So, I have played around with this choices data I do not. So, these are the choices data and the problem formulation is completely shown right in front of you here in this session. So, realistically, any product variant may have multiple attributes, how will that change the optimization problem, it will only increase the columns here, instead of only calculating w1 w2 you will have to calculate the weights for each attribute. So, there will be w1, w2, w3, w4, and wp all the way to get three-dimensional data. Similarly, v will have to be calculated. So, here also the columns will get added v1 v2 v3 v4 correspondingly the coordinates will have to be found for each of the attributes attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3, attribute 4 and so on. So, the columns will get added. Similarly, you will have to calculate the ajp, ajkp values we have only calculated ajk2 you will have to calculate bjk1, bjk2, bjk3, and so on. This will have no difference this part of the formulation will be no different at this part of the formulation will be no different. You are not going to make any change you are simply going to shift it to the right because the columns are getting added to the left. So, you will have no change in the z variables, because simply they are defined for each pairwise data. And pairwise data does not depend on the number of attributes, pairwise data does not depend on the number of attributes there is no p here. So only jk. So, the z variables are not going to change only you will have more w variables, more v variables, and therefore more x to be calculated. How what happens if you have more variants to choose from, right more variants to choose from, so you are increasing the number of choices, if you increase the number of choices then will go up n will go up and therefore, you will have to ask the consumers more preferences, she had we asked the consumers preferences on 10 pairs and into n minus 1 divided by 2. So, if the if there are more product variants, then we will have to ask consumers about their preferences for each pairwise comparison and therefore, there will be more rows getting added to this table, because then we will have to ask the consumer, what does she prefer here and what does she prefer here. So, if there was a product variant six, then I like to ask the consumer. What does she prefer between 1 and 6? What does she prefer between 2 and 6? What does she prefer between 3 and 6 and so on? All those preferences will have to be added here since more rows are getting added to this table? How will that change? How will that change here, how will that change here? So, you will have to essentially add more rows here because in the formulation in the formulation, these constraints, the first set of constraints, and the first set of constraints are essential for each ordered pair jk. Since now, we will have more ordered pair jk, you will have more of these types of constraints, more of these types of constraints, this is greater than or equal to 0 constraints. More of these constraints will be there. The last constraint, however, is going to be still the same summation of all the ajk value summation of all the bjk values and that is a kind of equality that is that kind of normalization constraint left-hand side equals the right-hand side, right-hand side is 1. So, that constraint is not going to change because in the last constraint there is no ordered pair we are not we are only increasing the ordered pair so we are not touching the final constraint which is simply summation equal to one type of constraint. So, yeah, that is how the changes to the optimization problem will happen, but this is a simple linear programming formulation for our Conjoint Analysis Problem. So, let us end the session here and move to the next session, which is a Statistical Method.
