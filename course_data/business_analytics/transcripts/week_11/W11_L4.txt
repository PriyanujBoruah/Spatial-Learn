So, this is the data on which I am going to run the regression. I hope you do not want me to show you how to run the regression. You know, go to data, go to data analysis, go to regression, hit okay. Where are your y values? Your y values are here, these are your y values, where are your X values? Your x values are here. And I am copying the labels by design and say that yeah it has labels, I will ask Excel to put the output, put the output somewhere. I do not want to do that it is already done for you. Or I will show you later. Let me interpret this. So, I have already run the regression for you. In multiple linear regression, what does the R represent? In multiple linear regression if you recall, R represents the value, R represents the correlation coefficient between the actual y's, and the predicted y's, that correlation coefficient, so 97.5 percent correlation, strong correlation, because the data is hypothetical. In reality, you are not expected to see that kind of very high multiple R, but still a very, very strong association. So, my regression model is doing a good job of predicting the values of y which are actually matching with the observed values of y. R squared of 95, good, adjusted R squared of 93 percent, very good, there are 18 observations, . So, degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom n minus 1, 17, y the regression degrees of freedom 5, regression degrees of freedom 5 because there are five variables X2, X3, X5, X6, X7, therefore, how many betas you will have, beta 0, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, beta 5. So, we are essentially predicting the values of six variables, six parameters and therefore, 6 minus 1, 5, that is what that is. You know what does sum of squares, sum of squares means, what does mean of square means, what does F statistic means, look at this, what is this, this is my P value, my P value is of the range of 10 to the power of negative 7, I want this P value to be less than or equal to 0.05 actually less than 0.05, 5 percent, 95 percent confidence interval, 95 percent confidence level. So, I want this to be less than 0.05, it is of the order of 10 to the power of negative 7. So, my overall regression is significant, my overall regression is significant. These are the values, these are the values of my betas. So, this is beta 0 estimated using b 0, this is beta 1 estimated using b1, this is beta 2 estimated using b2. So, these are the values, these are the corresponding values, these are the corresponding values. How to look for individual sanity, individual, not sanity, individual validity, individual significance? Each of the beta is significant. Look at these P values, each of these individual P values are less than 0.05, they are each one of them, is less than 0.05. If you look at the confidence interval for each of the beta values, none of them have negatives, which means 0 is not part of the confidence interval, 0 is not part of the confidence interval, therefore, you are going to reject the null hypothesis that these betas are 0, you are going to reject that null hypothesis. You could look at, you could reject the null hypothesis by looking at the confidence interval And say that these the confidence interval does not contain 0 or you are going to reject the null hypothesis simply by looking at the P value and say that the P value is less than 0.05. And therefore, the null hypothesis that the beta individual beta is 0 is rejected. So, these are the individual estimations of beta value, these are not beta values we are not going to say that anyway we are always going to say that these are the estimates of our beta values. So, 1.33 is actually b0 which estimates which is used to estimate beta 0 and so on. So, Vivo was variable X2, Xiomi was a variable X3, this was X4 was deleted, so this was X5, this was X6 and this was X7 because X8 was deleted. So, this is what it is, we do not have to dwell on interpreting the regression output further, the focus is now going to shift to interpreting these beta values. Convince yourself that you have understood the output of regression. Anyway, we are going to later on share this Excel sheet with you and you can play with it and understand the regression part of this, the focus is as I said not on the regression trying to interpret these values. Let us go to PPT now. Let us summarize what we have just said from the regression output. So, what can we say about the regression output? So, the regression equation, regression equation is the 1.334 which was the intercept value plus 1.677 in Vivo plus 1.83 into Xiomi plus 2.334 into 6000 mAh battery plus 4.83 into 20 MP camera plus 2.16 into 13 MP camera. Just to make sure let us quickly go here, probably in difficulty in seeing this. So, let us delete this. So, 1.334 is the intercept, 1.166, 1.83, 2.33. Make sure that I have copied this correctly. So, 1.33 intercept 1.167 into Vivo 1.83 into Xiomi, 2.33 into 6,000, 4.83 into 4.83 into 20 MP camera 2.16 into 13 MP camera. So, that is your regression equation. As I said here betas have a special interpretation which is what we are going to focus on now. However, just to get the regression output out of the way we are going to say that yes regression is significant, the P value of the F test was amazingly good, individual betas are also significant, individual explanatory variables are also significant because we look at the individual P values, we looked at the individual confidence intervals and found that betas are not 0. Now, let us focus on these regression coefficients, they are going to be called as “part-worths”. So, this interpreting this 1.167 and 4.83 and 2.16 and all this, let us do that. So, what are partworths? So, partworths are essentially level utilities. What is the utility for that level of attribute? What is the utility for Samsung? Because Samsung is one of the levels in brands. What is the utility for Vivo as a brand? What is the utility for Xiomi as a brand? What is the utility for 4500 mAh battery capacity and so on. And remember, we said we had selected a base capacity, we have selected a base level. Since we have selected a base level, these utilities are going to be calculated only as a deviation from that base level, only as a deviation from that base limit. So, the total partworth of the entire product is essentially calculated from all the attributes and all the levels. But this is the total partworth, you can think of that as the utility, as the rating that the consumer has given you. That is the total worth of the product. That is the rating that the product has received. So that comes from combination of all the attributes and all the levels. But that rating does not tell me which component of that comes from each level from each attribute, that does not gets highlighted. What I get is a macro number, which is a total worth of the product. Think of total worth of the product as ratings. But that does not give me the split up. Partworths are essentially trying to do that. So, utility values for individual parts of the product, which are at each level of each attribute. Those are essentially partworths. As I said, in regression, we only get the relative partworths, not the absolute partworths. So, partworths for our data part, partworth for each of our attributes at each level. For the brand, Samsung was our base level, so Samsung gets a utility of 0 or partworth of 0, Vivo gets a partworth of 1.167, Xiomi gets a partworth of 1.834, relative to Samsung. Similarly, for the second attribute, which was the battery size, for the battery size 4500 mAh was our base level so that gets a utility or that gets a partworth of 0, 6000 mAh gets a partworth of 2.334. Now, where is this 2.334 coming from? Go back. Where is this 2.334? This is that 2.334. Similarly, what is this 1.167 and 1.834 those are the interpretations of the betas. So, betas are your partworth. So, 1.167 is for Vivo, 1.834 is for Xiomi and 1.167 is for Vivo. The last attribute was the front camera resolution, front camera resolution, 8 MP was our base level, and 13 MP use an increment of 2.167 from the base level, 20 MP gives me an increment of 4.83 utility over the base level. So, that is how the partworths or the total worth of the product is going to increase. So, the total worth of the product is going to increase 4.83 units if you move from 8 MP camera to 20 MP camera. The total worth of the product is going to move from Samsung to Xiomi by 1.834 units total worth is going to move up by 1.834 units. So, that is the partworth of each level of each attribute. Now, let us quickly understand what were the two questions that we answered from the optimization model for conjoint? We remember there were two variables W1, W2, W1 for attribute 1, W2 for attribute 2. What was the weightage? What was the importance given by the consumer for attribute 1? And what was the importance given by consumer 1 for attribute 2 when they gave us the choices? Here, we do not have choices we have ratings. So, now we want to answer that question. How much is the importance given by the consumer for each of these, each of these attributes brand, battery capacity, camera resolution are the attributes, When the consumer gave us the rating, what was the importance given to each one of these attributes? Let us answer that question. So, let us use partworth data to answer that question. So, let us now quantify the importance given by the consumer who gave us these ratings. The importance given by the consumer for each of the attributes. So, for brand, let us look at the partworth range. How do you calculate range? Range is the min value minus the max value, mean value is always 0, max value here is 1.834, min value is always 0, max value is 2.334, min value is 0, max value is 4.834. So, let us calculate the range. The attribute brand has a range of 1.834, battery has a range of 2.334, camera resolution has a range of 4.834. Let us add up the range data and we will get the total of ranges which is 9, almost 9, 9.002, 9. Now, let us calculate the importance in terms of percentage as 1.834 divided by 9, we will say that is the importance given by this consumer to the brand attribute. 2.334 divided by 9 will give us the importance given by this consumer to the battery capacity and 4.834 divided by 9 will give us the importance given by this consumer to the camera as an attribute. So, clearly, this consumer looked at the camera resolution the most because the importance attached was almost 53 percent, for battery it was the next which was about 26 percent and brand was least important to this consumer because brand only had an importance of about 20 percent. So, that is how you calculate the importance of each attribute given by this consumer. So, clearly this consumer was not brand conscious, brand only got a rate of importance about 20 percent. However, clearly this consumer was a too selfie fanatic, therefore, the front camera resolution mattered to this consumer the most. And therefore, she attached a rating of importance of about 53 percent or he attached importance of about 53 percent to camera resolution has an attribute. So, that is how you calculate the importance of each attribute. Now, second question was, second question that was answered by optimization was what is the ideal product, what is the ideal product? Now, actually speaking, you do not have to look at the ideal product here. All you have to do is go to the Excel sheet, and look at the combination which got the perfect rating, look at this or look at this, look at this both of them got a perfect rating 10 and 10. So, you can say either a Vivo with a 6000 mAh battery and a 20 MP front camera resolution is the perfect product or Xiomi with a 6000 mAh earlier I think I said it wrong, Vivo with a 6000 mAh battery and 20 MP camera or Xiomi with a 6000 mAh battery and 20 MP camera they are both the most preferred products, they are the most preferred products. So, ideally we did not have to calculate, remember we calculated X1, X2 in the optimization. Here, we got that value directly from the data itself. I do not have to calculate that. Now, few other things are here we had not taken price as one of the attributes. Obviously prices do matter people are price sensitive. How price sensitive they are? Could have been a certain by having price as one of the attributes. Now, one of the other advantage of having price as one of the attributes was to be able to calculate WTP willingness to pay, how much are they willing to pay, how much does the price change if the level of other attribute changes. So, we could have done that kind of analysis if we had prices as one of the attributes. So, WTP analysis unfortunately cannot be done using this data because we did not have price as one of the attributes. So, that was something, that is something that can be done using regression method. And last thing to be looked at last thing to be looked at is this within each attribute, we have actually ranked the levels, within each attribute, we have actually ranked the levels. So, within the brand, Samsung is the base brand, Samsung is the least preferred brand so to say, Vivo increases the utility by 1.16 unit, Xiomi actually increases the utility by 1.83 units. So, for this consumer, the ratings went up for Xiomi more than the ratings went up for Samsung. So, for this consumer, for this attribute, for this attribute within this Xiomi was the most preferred level. Similarly, for battery 4500 was the base level. The utility or the partworth went up by 2.33 units, therefore 6000 mAh was the most preferred level of battery capacity. Similarly, 4.83 was the utility that is obtained the marginal utility that is obtained if you switch to a camera resolution of 20 MP from 8 MP, 8 MP gives you a utility of 0, 20 MP use you a utility of 4.83. So, an increase of 4.83 units. So, this is the most preferred level for this attribute. So, this kind of analysis is what is available using regression as a method to solve conjoint. And we have also told you what is the importance given by this consumer to each of these attributes. So, why did I, finally why did I not take price as one of the attributes and solve the problem? Well, I saw many examples where that was already done, and those are all available online. So, I will definitely recommend you to take a look at one of those because as I said conjoint analysis using a traditional multiple linear regression is the most commonly used example. So we have plenty of examples available on various online resources as well as various textbooks. So, let us end the session here. And hopefully I have explained, I have explained the regression application for conjoint analysis.
