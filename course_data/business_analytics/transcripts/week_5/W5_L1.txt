Good afternoon and welcome to this new session. We will continue our discussion on the relationship between price and demand. So, in the last session, we had seen what a demand response curve is. It is essentially a relationship between price and the corresponding demand at that particular price. So, usually, we get data by collecting experiments by offering different prices. A retailer can offer different prices in the market and see what kind of demand is realized at that price. So, price is usually the explanatory variable, which is on the x-axis, and demand gets reflected on the y-axis because it is a response from the market. So, we had seen last time the linear relationship between price and demand, and we saw that we could actually forecast the equation using a simple linear regression model. We also saw one of the examples where we talked about the constant elasticity curve, and we said that in that case, the relationship between price and demand is not linear. If you recall from the last session, the relationship that we spoke about was, in particular, a relationship of this type. We said demand at a particular price is actually c multiplied by p to the power of negative epsilon. So, where c was a constant, if you recall c was a constant, we said c is actually a constant which reflects demand at a price equal to 1. So, this is the demand at a price equal to 1, and epsilon was the constant elasticity, and we had defined elasticity in the last session. So, here the relationship is clearly not linear between the demand and the price. And we want to understand how do we estimate the value of c and the value of epsilon if we have data for this experiment. So, the experiment is still going to be the same. We are still going to say that we are going to offer various prices in the market and the prices we will offer Rs.10 and Rs.3 and Rs.4 and Rs.23 and so on. And we will collect the corresponding demand that is realized in the market, whatever those values are. So, this is the data that we have. Now, from this data, if we say that the relationship is non-linear and non-linear of this type, can we then use, can we still use regression and estimate the value of c, estimate the value of this constant, and estimate the value of elasticity from the data that we have. So, but, if we say that we will use a simple linear regression or as we call it in the last session, simple linear regression model does not matter what you call it is a simple linear regression model, you include M as an acronym or not, we can use different notations. So, the moment we say that we are going to use simple linear regression, this relationship is clearly not linear. So, how can we still use simple linear regression? Do you have any clues? Anything from your BDM course?
