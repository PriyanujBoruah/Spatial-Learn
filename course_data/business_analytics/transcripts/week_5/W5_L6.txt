Let us understand this, this price maximizes profit. Now, if an organization wants to say that I do not care, I want to have the maximum possible profit, then they should be charging 26 rupees as the price of the product. Whereas, if the objective of the organization is to maximize revenue, then they should be charging only 18.5 rupees. So, 18.5 rupees if you want to maximize the revenue whereas 26 rupees if you want to maximize the profit. Now, this is where we wish to draw your attention too. Generally, we would have thought that the prices that maximize revenue would be the same price that maximizes profit also. Clearly, it is not the case. Even for linear relationship between demand and price that does not hold. So, let us take a look at this little more closely. Let us go to Excel sheet. This was my linear relationship. Now, let us go to price optimization. So, this was the data, for this data the predicted demand. From the regression I know my intercept was 5842. From the regression I know my slope was negative 157.7. Therefore, I can have the predicted demand, my predicted demand is intercept plus slope into price. So, this is the predicted value of the demand, this is the actual demand. I will only take the predicted value of the demand. I will calculate revenue. How did we calculate revenue? Revenue as demand multiplied by the price. So, this is demand multiplied by the price. Everywhere is the same thing, demand multiplied by the price. If you plot this revenue function, you are going to get this blue dotted line. Sometimes the profit does become negative, for some cases the profit is negative, so there is some negative blue dots here negative blue dots. Negative in the sense they are below the X-axis. And you can see from the numerical plot itself you can see that the curve is concave. However, you should get the second derivative to confirm that your revenue curve is concave. Now, just take a look at this, where does the curve seems to maximize, where does the blue curve, if this is the blue curve, this seems to be the blue concave revenue curve. It seems to have peaked at around this value. This seems to be the peak or somewhere here which is close to 18, somewhere even left of this. So, this is the price somewhere here, I may not have drawn this perfectly correctly, somewhere here is the maximum value of the revenue and that happens at this price somewhere around 18-19 that price range. This is the profit, this is the revenue curve which seems to be concave and if I want to find the price that maximizes revenue, it seems to be in this range. Now, let us look at the profit for that I need marginal cost. So, I had assumed marginal cost to be 15. What is profit? Profit is demand multiplied by P minus C. So, this is demand multiplied by P minus C. So, different values of profit at different prices because different demand is expected And this is your profit curve. So, this is your profit curve. From the shape of it, it looks concave. However, you should get the second derivative to confirm. Now, if I wish to find a price that maximizes the profit, where does the profit seems to be maximum, it seems to be maximum here somewhere, seems to be maximum here somewhere. So, somewhere here in this price range is the price that actually maximizes the profit, maximizes the profit and as we found out it is in the range of 26. So, the price that maximizes the revenue is here. So, they may not, they need not be the same price points, the prices that maximize the revenue need not be the prices that maximize the profit. And obviously, if you are marginal cost changes. You do some cost cutting measures in your operations and turns out that your marginal cost is not 15, your marginal cost is 12, obviously, your profit curve is going to change. your revenue curve is not going to change at all, your revenue is essentially what you get from your sales. You doing a cost cutting operation in your factory is not going to change your sales, your revenue is not going to change. Your profit curve may change and therefore, the optimal price point may also change for the profit curve. So, clearly you see that the red curve which was our earlier profit curve is not the same anymore. Now, the profit is slightly larger,because we have done some cost cutting measures. We are done some cost cutting measures. And therefore, I am hoping to get higher profits and at that higher profits, my optimal price that maximizes my profit may also shift from 26 to something else. So, obviously, this is expected behaviour, if my marginal cost changes my profit changes and therefore, I get different values for my optimal prices that maximizes the revenue. Now, the curve is going to exactly fit my red curve. So, once again going back, you can optimize prices but your objective has to be very clear, a business has to be very clear about what does it wish to achieve. Now, there may be certain conditions where you may want to show massive revenues. Revenue is essentially a lot of people buying our product, because revenue is calculated as whatever I can sell in the market multiplied by price. Clearly, if I offer slightly lesser prices, I can hope to get more customers to buy my product. So, and therefore, my optimal prices to maximize my revenue was 18 whereas the optimal prices that maximizes my profit was 26. If I look at the curve, if I see the revenue at my price point 26, if I look at my revenue, my revenue is somewhere here, clearly that is not the maximum revenue, my maximum revenue is well past here. So, at the price point of 26, my revenue may be lesser than what I could achieve, but my profit is maximized. So, when you are optimizing the price, the lesson from this session is you should be very clear about what objectives do you have. Are you focusing on maximizing the revenue? Are you focusing on maximizing the profit? With that, let us close this session. Hopefully this has motivated you to look at optimization also as a very interesting branch of Business Analytics. With that, let us close the session. Thank you.
