[Music] now let us go one step further now let us say that i still want to find the optimal prices this time i don't want to maximize revenues i want to maximize profits so what is profit profit function is usually whatever i earn minus whatever i spend that is my profit so whatever whatever is my sales revenue my sales revenue is the net uh inflow to me right that is the income minus whatever i spend how much do i spend in general uh if i sell 10 products i will have to manufacture those 10 products and the cost of producing those 10 products will be my expenses so for now so yes a profit is a difference between revenue and the cost revenue is the sales revenue let us say that the marginal cost of producing the product is c right marginal cost of producing the product is c so if i sell 10 products i have to manufacture those 10 products and i am going to spend a 10 into c uh as the total cost of producing these 10 products if i sell d units of products it will be d into c right so that is my total cost my marginal cost is c therefore the total cost is going to be how many products i sold multiplied by the marginal cost of that product therefore what is going to be the profit function profit function is going to be this difference between revenue and cost what is revenue our total revenue is the total revenue is uh whatever i sell in the market multiplied by whatever price i charge right so this is the this is the net sales revenue so this is coming from sales of goods this is the product production cost right cost of producing so c is my marginal cost of producing each unit how many units do i sell i sell dp number of units and therefore my total cost is going to be dp into c total cost is going to be dp into c therefore the profit which is generally indicated by pi of p p is to just to indicate that it is a function of price it is a function of price so profit as a function of price is demand at that particular price multiplied by the price that is charged in the market so this is your total revenue minus demand multiplied by the marginal cost okay just just make sure that you have digested this equation fairly straightforward equation now the the thing that we are going to do is very similar to what we had done for profit maximization for revenue maximization for revenue maximization what did we do next we said well this demand this demand is a function of price and we will we will write that linear relationship so we will replace this d of p with we will replace this d of p with the equation right so now what are we trying to find we are trying to find the optimal price which means that i don't know the price i don't know the price that i am going to charge i do know the market size i know i do know the market size which is d naught i do know the slope right i i know how the demand changes with respect to price i know the marginal cost right because that is the cost that i am going to incur to produce each product i i need to decide what should be the optimal price to charge in the market right so let us let us simplify this let us simplify this some value okay how are we going to maximize this profit function now very similar we are going to use first order necessary condition first order necessary condition says take the partial derivative of profit with respect to price set the partial derivative equal to zero so this is the partial derivative of the profit function with respect to price turns out to be like this right turns out to be like this you can verify that this equation is correct when i take the partial derivative of profit with respect to price you can guarantee that you can verify that this is the this is the expression that i'm going to get and when i said this partial derivative with respect to 0 i get the optimal price as this expression as this expression okay this is the optimal price what do i mean by optimal price this is the price that maximizes profit this is the price that maximizes profit once again i expect the profit curve to be also a concave curve a concave curve so this is my price on the x-axis this is my profit on the y-axis which is indicated by pi function and i'm saying that there is some value of p there is some value of p p star which is given by this expression here at this point the profit is maximum okay so the profit is maximum okay so this is the this is the value of the p at which the profit is maximized once again just like for revenue maximization you should find the second derivative and make sure that our curve is a concave curve and we are not getting the minimum value of the profit right but once again we will leave that mathematical part out and let us focus on the pricing part okay so for our example for our numerical numerical example i already know the d naught i already know the market size i know the slope let us have some value of the marginal cost let us have some value of the marginal cost and then try to find the optimal prices okay so now if i assume that the marginal cost is 15 the c is 15 then the optimal price the profit maximizing price turns out to be 26.02 26.02
