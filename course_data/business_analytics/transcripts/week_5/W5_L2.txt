Waiting for you to think. But essentially what we are thinking about is modelling a constant elasticity model using simple linear regression and what we do is when we clearly know that the relationship is not linear, we actually transform the equation. So, we actually transform the equation and still model the curved patterns, the relationship is clearly not linear. So, what kind of transformations? What do we mean by transformations first of all? So, essentially a simple linear regression model of this type y is equal to beta naught plus beta 1x plus epsilon. So, sorry epsilon is this error term and epsilon we are separating out, elasticity and epsilon. Let us say this is an error term, so, this is an error. So, this is your response variable, this is your explanatory variable. Now, this relationship is linear. Our current relationship is not linear c into p to the power of negative epsilon. So, this epsilon is the elasticity. This is elasticity okay. So, we transform y. We transform D, we transform P in such a way that we get a linear relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable. So, how do you decide which transformation? What do you mean by transformation? We can use instead of y we can use 1 by y or we can use log of y or we can use y squared. These are transformations of y instead of using y. I can use different functions reciprocal of y, log of y, polynomial of y. Similarly, I can use 1 by x or log of x or polynomial x. So, by using these transformations I will convert a non-linear relationship to a linear relationship. So, what are the usual guidelines for transforming your explanatory variable and response variable? Usually, this is the rule of thumb. So, we can pick the correct transformation using this following diagram. So, if the relationship between x and y is of this type, if the relation is your explanatory variable, this is your response variable and the relationship looks like this and the relationship looks like this, then we are talking about this kind of relationship. So, we say that transformation y squared x squared may be more appropriate. So, wherever you have a response variable, you square it. Wherever you have an explanatory variable, you square it and use that transformation. On the other hand, let me erase this. If the relationship between x and y looks something like this, then usually transforming the log, transforming the explanatory variable is sufficient. Either a log transformation or a reciprocal transformation of the explanatory variable is sufficient to convert a non-linear relationship to a linear relationship. Similarly, what do I mean by this? Let me erase this and then we say that the relationship between x and y looks something like this which is the same shape, same shape here. So, if the relationship between x and y is like this which is clearly non-linear to transform this nonlinear relationship into linear relationship, either we can transform y or we can transform x or do both. So, either we can take the log transformation of y or a reciprocal transformation of y we can take the log of transformation of x or reciprocal transformation of x or do both and then we can get a linear transformed association between response variable and the explanatory variable. Now, when we say our relationship is of this type, if we say that the relationship is of this type clearly, we are talking about this kind of relationship. So, this equation, if we put a price on the x axis and if we put demand on the y axis, this equation is going to look like this. So, let us try a log transformation. What do I mean by a log transformation? So, let me erase all this now. So, we have already decided that we are going to use transformation, we have already decided that our transformation is going to be of log type. So, here let us write the transformed equation, let us take log of both sides. So, we will take log of D or let us do better. So, let us take a natural log, log of D is equal to log of c plus negative epsilon log of p. That will be the correct equation once we take the log transformation taking log of both sides, the left hand side log, log of D. Right hand side log will become like this. And now, if we say that this is my response variable, my response variable is no longer D but it is actually log of D, natural log of D. I do not say that my explanatory variable is price but it is actually log of price. So, this is my explanatory variable. So, I have changed my explanatory variable. I have transformed my explanatory variable, earlier my explanatory variable was simply x, my response variable was simply y and the relationship was linear. Now, I have taken a transformation. My response variable is a log of D, my explanatory variable is a log of price and now, the relationship looks like a linear relationship. So, this way this can be considered to be y, this can be considered to be x. So, this is of this type y is equal to beta naught plus beta 1x, where x is log of price, y is log of D, the beta naught is log of c. Anyway, c was a constant, so, log of c will be a constant. So, that is your y intercept and beta naught or beta 1 is the slope which is negative of the elasticity. Now, I know how to do this, if I run a simple linear regression, simple linear regression essentially is going to give me an estimate for beta naught, it is going to give me an estimate of beta 1. There I interpreted beta naught to be directly the y intercept which gives me the market size. Here beta naught is going to say it is log of c. So, to actually get the value of c, I need to take the antilog and get the value of c. Remember what C was? C was the demand when price was equal to 1. So, that was a constant. Similarly, the slope from my simple linear regression estimation, my beta 1 estimate is going to directly give me the elasticity value. Negative of elasticity value. So, let us run this. So, let us see this on the slide again. So, log-log transformation. So, I am going to get a log of demand, log of price. So, this becomes my new response variable. This becomes my new explanatory variable and this becomes my y intercept and this becomes my slope.
