Welcome to this new topic. From. Now, onwards for the 3 or 4 videos, we are going to discuss Consumer Choice Models. Now, if you take the economic economics literature, consumer choices or choice models have a different probabilistic interpretation. Our approach is going to be different. We are not talking about the economic idea of choice models, but we are more talking about the marketing idea of consumer choice models. So, what we wish to understand is the choices made by the consumer and how they are making it. So, some kind of psychological analysis. But obviously, this is a course on business analytics, and therefore we are going to take a very quantitative approach to this journey into consumers’ minds when they make a choice about a particular product. So, this journey, particularly, we are going to take the journey in the sense of conjoint analysis. So, I will define conjoint analysis in a minute, but there are various choice models there are various consumer choice models. We are going to take the approach of explaining conjoint analysis. So, as always, before we get into the quantitative techniques, before we understand what kind of data, let us understand what this technique is, what these are set of techniques actually. So, let us understand what conjoint analysis actually means. So, let us take this example. So, let us take, let us walk through a thinking process of a consumer. So, let us say that this particular consumer is trying to decide amongst four products and she may have to buy finally one product or it may be four variants of a product. So, she is comparing these four products, and she is deciding which one to buy. Now, let us say that these products, we have two attributes available to this product, or at least we have data for the two attributes for these products or these variants. If once we ask the consumer their preferences, let us say that we also have their consumer choice data. Let us have the, let us make sure that we have this data available to us. Now, what we wish to understand, is if I am a market researcher if I am a marketer, what I wish to understand. What I wish to know is essential, what is the thinking process. When do I say that the product is split into two attributes, how much importance is provided for each of the attributes by a particular consumer? So, how important are these attributes for a particular consumer? So secondly, once I understand that this attribute is important, this attribute is not important. This level of an attribute is important. What do I mean by the level of an attribute? I will explain that in a minute. Once I understand how these attributes are important or not so important, the next question that I wish to answer, if I am a market researcher or if I am selling the product to the consumer, is, can I build my own product, if I know the choices data. I know the consumer prefers this. I know that the consumer does not prefer this. I know the consumer has more importance for this attribute; the consumer does not have the importance for this attribute. Can I actually build an ideal product from the perspective of a consumer, an ideal product that a consumer would like to buy? Why is this kind of analysis important? Let us say that the consumer is interested. Let us pick a product consumer is interested in buying a car. Now, what do I mean by attributes? By attributes, we mean various features of the car. What is the engine capacity? What is the seating capacity? Is it a SUV, or is it an urban car? Is it a sedan? What color is the car? What is the luggage capacity? What brand is it? These are all the features. These are all the features. These are all the attributes. So, when we say we have data for two attributes in this example for a typical consumer when she buys a car, she has many many more attributes to consider. Now, the first question essentially asks, which attribute is important? For some consumers buying the most powerful car on the market is their priority number one. So, they probably give engine capacity the highest weightage. Some people say, no, I have a larger family size, and therefore seating capacity is important for me. Some people say that the safety features are most important to me. So, essentially these are the attributes that are important, and some of the attributes may not even be important. For example, I really do not care whether the color is light green or dark green. I do not care. So, some people are quote-unquote colorblind that way. So, some features are going to be important. Some attributes are going to be important; some attributes are not going to be important. And what is the second question? The second question then is, if I am a car seller, if I am Hyundai or if I am a Ford or if I am a Volkswagen, can I build the ideal car that the consumer would love? Can I build a car where the engine capacity is the most preferred engine capacity for the consumer? It can fit into; the car can fit the optimal number of people that the consumers want to fit in. So, that is the idea. The idea is can I find the attribute values of the ideal product attribute. What is the ideal product? Now, why is this kind of analysis difficult? This kind of analysis is difficult because a consumer really cannot separate, or it becomes difficult for the consumer to articulate the differences for each individual attribute at a time. For example, if you ask the consumer, do you want a 100 CC engine capacity? Do you want a 1200 CC engine capacity? They will say, yeah, but 200 is good, 1000 is good, but you cannot look at each of the attributes in isolation. It is a full product that I am buying; I am not buying only the engine of the car. So, even if I say I want the most powerful engine, that does not mean that they will simply go for the highest capacity engine that is available in the market. So, it becomes difficult for us to even collect this kind of data. So, I will say, okay, tell me the engine size. Tell me the color of the car. Tell me the brand of the car. Tell me whether you want ABS. So, depending on how many attributes we have, how many questions are you going to ask the consumer, and then construct the value system for the consumer, which means how much importance are they giving to each product, each attribute. And then finally, answer that ideal product question. It becomes difficult. Therefore, this analysis, this kind of consumer choice analysis, is a non-trivial task for any market researcher. So, let us go further on this. So, let us go back to our example. So, the consumer was comparing four variants of a product, and for each variant, we were collecting data on two attributes. So, that they have the, you can construct any product of this type. Let us say that this is the data. Let us say that there are four products, four products being compared. And this is the these are the values available on attribute 1. These are the values available on attribute 2. So, product 1 has an attribute value of 1.5 and attribute 2 of 12. Product 3 has attribute 1 value of 2.3 and attribute 2 value of 4. So, this could be any, any attribute. Attribute could be, as I said, the rating on safety rate. So, safety rating. Now, the safety rating generally is not in decimals, but you can remove it. You can have your own data instead of 1.5. You can say that is 3 instead of 2.3. You can say that is 3. So, any, any kind. So, this is attribute number 1. Attribute number 2 could be another rating. So, we can say average consumer, average consumer rating. Probably, I want to give importance to that when I am buying a car. I want to understand how others have rated the car. So, if others have rated the car highly, I will also think of this car as a good car. So, average consumer rating could be attributed to, and yeah, we are just hypothetically mentioned. We need the product need not even be the car. Now, so, this is the attribute data. This is the attribute data. These are the attribute; these are the two attributes and the data on that. Now, how are we collecting consumer choices? Now, conjoint analysis allows us to collect consumer choices in various formats. Now, we can simply say that there are four products, and I will ask the consumers to rate the four products. So, for example, I will ask the consumer to rank the four products. And that is the consumer choice data that I will collect. So, I will ask the consumer. And the consumer’s rank is, this is rank number 1, this is rank number 2, this is rank number 3, this is rank number 4. So, the consumer, this particular consumer, whom I asked the question, says that the product variant 4 is the best product for me. Then product number 2 would come in second place, product variant number 3 would come in third place, and product period number 1 would come in the fourth place, which is the last place. This means that this particular consumer that I asked prefers product variant 1 the least. So, we can collect consumer data as simply preferences; tell me the overall preferences or overall ranking for the product. Or I may collect consumer preferences in a pairwise format. So, for example, I will offer the pair saying between 1 and 2, between product variant 1 and 2; which one do you prefer? Between product variants 1 and 3, what do you prefer? Between product variants 1 and 4, what do you prefer? So, I may collect consumer choice data even on a pairwise basis. So, I will offer consumers choice pairs. So, I will ask the consumer, between product variant 1 and product variant 2, what do you prefer? And then, the consumer will tell me that the consumer prefers 1 over 2. When I ask the consumer, what is your preference between 1 and 4? So, the consumer says I prefer 4 over 1. Between the pairs 2 and 4 the consumer prefers 2 over 4. So, I can collect pairwise preference data, or I can collect overall preference data. So, both are admissible. So, what kind of data do we have for consumer preferences? That may dictate what kind of analysis we will have to do? Or to answer the two questions that we had put up in the previous slide? So, I hope the situation is clear to you. Now, so, as I said, the product could be anything, it could be as I said of buying a car or it could be thinking of buying potato chips. So, let us say that the product or the commodity that the consumer is trying to buy is potato chips, a packet of potato chips. And the two attributes that the consumer is looking at are. Obviously, you want the potato chips to be crispy and not soggy. And potato chips everybody likes them, everybody loves potato chips. And therefore, you would want quantity like larger quantity in a pack as possible. So, obviously, that means that consumers would prefer a pack of 150 grams over 100 grams. So, a quantity. So, and then a consumer is obviously prepared to compare four variants of products or four different brands probably or four different varieties of the same company. Lays has so many chips and so many types of chips, and the consumer is preferring, the consumer is giving choices of four variants of Lays chips. So, it could be different organizations being compared. It could be different brands being compared. It could be different products from the same organization being compared. So, it could be any product variety. And then she prefers them, and then the consumer has given her choices. As we saw, the choices could be in terms of pairwise data. In a pair, I will tell you whether I prefer A versus B, or it could simply be preference scores. I will simply rank them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, where 1 could be, 1 could mean the most preferred product or it could be ranking or it could be scale ranking, where I say 10 is the best product and 1 is the least preferred product. Any way we define reference scores. So that is the choices data that she is going to give us. What the market researcher would like to know is the importance or the weights. What are the optimal weights that the consumer is attaching to the crispiness of the chips and to the quantity that is available in the pack? That is what we wish to know. What are the weights assigned by the consumer? Now, the consumer is going to say that, well, I want crispier products, but I also want a large quantity. But when she is giving us the choices, can we guess whether she is giving more importance to crispiness and more importance to or more importance to quantity. And essentially, answering the second question on the previous slide, then the market researcher would like to build the ideal chips packet. The ideal chips packet that would be preferred by this consumer. She has given you choices, and based on these choices, can you build a model and construct this ideal chips packet, so to say. That is what we wish to do. And how do we wish to do this? We wish to do this using a process called conjoint analysis. So, what is conjoint analysis? Very literally speaking, conjoint analysis means the analysis of features considered jointly. That is why the term conjoint. We are not going to look at each attribute in isolation, as I said earlier. That is difficult. Sometimes asking the set of questions to the consumer itself becomes tiresome. The consumer is going to give up and, therefore, psychologically not be interested in answering your questions. So, cognitive dissonance or what are the terms like that will kick in. So, we are going to look at all the attributes together and analyze them together; that is why it is called conjoint analysis. This technique is actually not new. It has been around for quite some time. In fact, the conjoint analysis the origins come from a research article that was written way back in 1964, and the article was actually published in a journal called Journal of Mathematical Psychology, which is very apt, which is why I decided to put it on the slide that this is what we wish to do. We wish to understand the consumer’s thinking process. We want to understand consumer psychology by building mathematical models. And in this discussion, we are actually going to discuss two mathematical models. One is a more statistical model, and one is an optimization model. So, this process, this conjoint analysis, is a set of techniques that has its origin way back more than 50 years ago, almost 60 years ago now. And very aptly, it comes from the field of mathematical psychology. Professor Paul Green at Walter University is accredited with a developing conjoint analysis. He has extensively written on various aspects of conjoint analysis, various models, various applications, and lots of research that can be attributed to Professor Green. And we are going to discuss a few more models as we go along. So, this is a well-established set of techniques that have been around for some time. So, essentially what is conjoint analysis? Conjoint analysis can be defined as a set of features family of techniques. What are we trying to do? We are trying to model choices provided by the consumer. How are we going to do that? We are going to decompose the overall preferences or evaluation. The consumer has provided the overall preferences or evaluation for the particular product. And how are we going to decompose? We are going to decompose in terms of relative values of the components or attributes. We are going to assign weights. We are going to assign relative weights to the attributes. And then we are hopefully through that process. We are going to try and understand what the consumer is thinking. So, in some ways, we are getting into the consumer’s mind and trying to understand their value system. So, do they value this product more? Do they value this other product more? Do they value this attribute more? Do they value this other attribute more? So, we are essentially trying to construct a value system for a consumer by asking them about their preferences for a small subset of products. And essentially, hopefully, try to make predictions from that model that builds us the value system. And when we look at the optimization model for conjoint analysis, in the sense of optimization, we are then trying to construct the best product. We will try to construct the best product, a product that has attributes at the most desirable level to the consumer. That is what we will build. And that is what conjunct analysis tries to build.
