Now, Conjoint Analysis is of various types, various forms of conjoint analysis. So, let us quickly look at various types of conjoint analysis. Now, choice-based, choice-based conjoint analysis is the most commonly used form of conjoint analysis, where the consumer is offered a set of four options, let us say three or four options. And the consumer tells us out of this set of three or four options that you are providing me. I prefer this the most, the most preferred full profile product. Full profile means I am not offering attribute by attribute of comparisons. I will not say, oh, there are four engine values of 800 CC, 1000 CC, 1200 CC, and 2000 CC. I am not giving you that. I am giving you the full car. I will give you the attribute values probably. I will give you these five attributes, and these are the values for each of the cars. And in this set, let us say I have three or four cars, and I will ask you which car you prefer the most. So, what I am asking you is, I am going to ask you for your preferences on a full profile product, not decomposed productsâ€”not decomposed at their attribute level. I will give you attribute data. So this kind of analysis is called choice-based conjoint analysis. Now, there is something called adaptive conjoint analysis. The problem with the choice-based analysis is, it is a fixed set of questions that we keep on asking the consumers, and depending on how many products we wish to offer to the consumer, how many choices do we wish to offer to the consumer, the number of questions may get too many. Adaptive conjoint analysis, on the other hand, is, as it says it is adaptive. So, essentially if it varies the choices of the set provided to the consumer depending on what kind of preferences they are giving us. So, in set 1, let us say in set 1, they have given us a particular preference. I may construct the set based on the preference given by the consumer in set 1. So, I adopt my questions in such a way that I can get all the information from the consumer, probably, in less time or less number of questions. So, essentially, that helps me get the responses from the consumer faster before the consumer gets cognitively tired. The third type of consumer analysis is the full profile consumer analysis. The full profile consumer analysis. Something that we saw a couple of slides ago. The full suite of options is presented. The consumer is present in comparing four variants of the product. I will offer, I will give them the data for all the four options. I will give the data for all four options. Against the choice-based model, where I construct smaller sets, I construct, let us say, a set of three products and then the set of two products more and then the set of three products; out of that, which product do you prefer most, out of this which product do you prefer most. That is not then done. That is not done in the full profile conjoint analysis. Full profile content analysis is similar to what we had a couple of slides ago, where we had given the full data to the consumer on two attributes and asked the consumers to give us their preferences. And the last type of consumer analysis, there are many more, but these are the most commonly used. The last type of consumer analysis that we can quickly describe is called menu-based conjoint analysis. In many ways, in conjoint analysis, what we do is we actually ask the consumer to build the product. We ask the consumer to build the product by giving them a list of attributes and their associated prices. And then, the consumer is asked to pick on attribute 1. What value do you prefer for attribute 1. For example, engine size. What engine size do you prefer? Or do you prefer leather seats? Yes, no. So, for each attribute I want to the consumer, then gives me choices. So, consumer for each attribute, the consumer chooses what they want in their ideal product, in their ideal product, keeping prices in mind. So, as I said, one of the objectives of conjoint analysis is actually to build the value system for the consumer what the consumer is thinking. Now, for example, let us say that in the car example, let us construct a car example. Let us say that you said attribute, leather seats. You say leather seats. So, let us say a leather seat is going to cost the consumer 100 dollars. And let us pick a different attribute. Let us say that the AC vents on the passenger side. AC vents on the passenger side are also a feature, and let us say that that is also going to cost the consumer 100 dollars. Now, if the consumer prefers leather seats, if the consumer prefers to go for a leather seat which is going to cost them 100 dollars instead of going for AC vents that is going to give cost them 100 dollars. We definitely know that seat quality is more important to the consumer or rather than the air quality in the car. So, that is the way to understand what is the value system for the consumer. So, menu-based conjoint analysis offers the choice of, offers the option for the consumer to actually build the product on their own. So, these are the various types of conjoint analysis. In this discussion, the mathematical models that we are going to look at are more focused on the full profile conjoint analysis or more focused on the full profile conjunct analysis. But I just wanted to highlight that there are various types of various forms of conjoint analysis and all of them are quite popular, quite popular. In fact, there are more than these four types that we have put up on the slide. We have described these four because they are more commonly used but depending on what is the objective of the market researcher and what goals do they have from this conjunct analysis, they may prefer one particular form of conjoint analysis over the other form of conjoint analysis. In addition to that, let me also tell you that there are various commercially available software packages that can help you conduct conjoint analysis on a set of consumers. So, depending on what form of conjoint analysis do you want to go with, it will actually construct or it will help you construct the questions that you wish to ask the consumer and actually walk you through the process, perform all the statistical analysis, perform all the mathematical analysis and actually give you the output in a form that is most useful to you. So, the point that is being made is there are commercially available software packages that can help you conduct conjoint analysis. We are going to see two such methods, but they are we are actually going to walk them through. You are not going to get automatic answers. You have to build the model, run the model and then get the results that these commercially available packages are going to give you readily. All right. Let us move on. Let us talk about the applications of conjoint analysis and how a market researcher can use conjoint analysis. The conjoint analysis finds applications in many ways. A market researcher can use it in many ways. For example, in marketing or advertising or communication. Once you understand that some of the features or some of the attributes are more important, as we discussed in the previous slide, if you somehow find out that the seat quality is more important than the air vents on the back side, if that is more important, then once you build the communication channels with the consumer, you can highlight, you can highlight that these are the attributes that I will give you. Because I know that these attributes are important for you, once I know that these are the attributes that are most preferred by the consumers, then all these attributes can get highlighted in all the communication that I can have with the consumer. For example, my advertising will highlight the fact that this car is a very powerful car if I know that you like powerful cars. In all my promotions, when I offer sales promotions, for example, I will offer sales promotions based on the attribute values that I know the consumers like. So that way, conjoint analysis can help us in marketing. More importantly, once I know that these are the set of consumers that like this attribute, are the set of consumers that like this attribute, then I can very, very organically, very organically I can help. I can actually get the market segmented and then offer various choices, various prices, and various options to each segment depending on what are the preferences of the consumers in that particular segment. So that way, conjoint analysis can help me in marketing. Conjoint analysis can also help me in R & D, product development. Now, if I had performed a conjoint analysis before I started my product development, I would know which attributes are more important to the consumer and what are the levels are most preferred by the consumers. Once I do that, then in my product development, I can work on refining these attributes that have been found to be important for the consumers. And hopefully, build a product that the consumer would like. So, essentially, in my product development, I can spend my time only on the attributes that are important. So, I can neglect, if I know that consumers do not care about the color of the car, I need not spend time, or I need not spend my resources on deciding what should be the optimal color of the car. So, yeah, and once I narrow down these are the attributes, then all my R & D focus can be only on this set of attributes that have been identified by conjoint analysis. So that way, conjoint analysis helps me in product development. Conjoint analysis helps me in pricing. Obviously, very clearly, you can see that because conjunct analysis gives me the most preferred products or most preferred attributes. Now, the pricing can be decided based on whether the product contains a high level of the attribute that is preferred. For example, for motorbikes, if the consumer is buying a motorbike and she tells you that she likes a high-powered engine, then obviously, the motorbike with a higher horsepower can be sold at a premium. So, that way it can help me price the product because now I have identified the important attributes, and I can play with the pricing based on the levels of the attribute that are present in that particular model. More importantly, this is a more overt application. Implicitly, the biggest advantage of conjoint analysis is conjoint analysis, at least indirectly, helps me identify the willingness to pay. It can reveal consumers' willingness to pay for a particular attribute. Obviously, if the attribute is important for the consumer, the consumer will be more; the consumer will be willing to pay more money to get that attribute. So, conjoint analysis helps us in identifying the WTP, Willingness To Pay function for the consumer. And now, that is it is a very important contribution to pricing. So, what is the process that we are going to follow? The process that we are going to follow are we are going to define products as a combination of attributes. We saw a couple of slides ago. We can have two attributes, three attributes, and four attributes. So, products are going to be defined only as a collection of attributes, and having the consumers react to these alternatives, these alternative offerings, or each alternative offering is a collection of the attribute. And we know quantitatively what are the levels of attributes that we are offering. Now, one can look at each attribute's importance. How is each attribute important? So, the optimal weight is identified by the consumer for this particular attribute. And secondly, what is the most desired level of each attribute? What is the most desired level for each attribute for the customer? So, that is what we are going to do. As I said, we are going to look at two mathematical models in conjoint analysis, one is based on an optimization technique, and the other one is based on a statistical technique. Both essentially try to do the same thing. So, we will end the session here and get into the mathematical aspects of conjoint analysis in the next session. Thank you.
