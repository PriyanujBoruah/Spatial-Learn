Welcome back to this session on Content Analysis. In this session, we are going to look at the optimization formulation of the conjoint problem. So, if you recall in the last session, we said we are going to collect the data on the product variants on various attributes. And then we are also going to collect data on the consumer preferences, what does the consumer choices are? So, either the problem can be solved using mathematical methods like optimization or the problems can be solved using statistical method. In this session, we are going to explain the formulation of the optimization problem. Now, in the optimization formulation itself, there have been lots of attempts, very insightful optimization problems formulated that get really sophisticated and complicated, what we are going to discuss is a very basic linear programming formulation for the conjoint analysis problem, in particular, the formulation that we are going to discuss in this session comes from this article. So, this article is famously referred to as the LINMAP. LINMAP method and it is a very old article, whereas relatively older article. So, Professor Srinivasan at Rochester at the time, University of Rochester at that time and Allan Shocker, so, whatever we are going to describe, in fact, the notations we are going to describe are essentially from this article. So, let us get into what this optimization problem is and as we highlighted, this is the simplistic formulation, this is the linear programming formulation of the conjoint analysis problem. So, let me explain this formulation geometrically first. So, let me explain that on a graph and let me for now, simplify the product and say that the products are is defined only on two attributes. In the last session we described that the product can be defined on multiple dimensions, for example, a car has so many dimensions, the engine and the seating capacity, the car type whether it is a coupe or a sedan or a SUV. So, it has multiple dimensions, it has color, it has brand or it has safety features, so many attributes. To geometrically explain all that, let me reduce the dimensions and say that the product is defined only on two dimensions, two attributes. So, this is something similar to the potato chips example that we had described in the last session, where we said the potato chips are described on two attributes, crispiness and the quantity of potato chips in a pack. So, two attributes. So, let us say that these are the two attributes, attribute one is on the x-axis, attribute two is on the y-axis and for these attributes, let us define each product variant each option that is made available to the consumer and asked about the choices. So, every product variant will have two dimensions for example, let us say O1 is here and it will have a, it will have an x-axis coordinate and it will have y-axis coordinate. So, this is the y coordinate, this is the x coordinate for product variant number one in the notation of the article, it is actually referred to as Y11 and Y12. Y11 is the value on the attribute one and Y12 is the value on the attribute one for product variant one. So, the first notation here denotes the variant and the second subscript here denotes the attribute. So, for product variant one, what are the values on each of the attribute dimensions? So, obviously, like we have discussed earlier, we are not going to offer a single product variant to the consumer, we are going to offer a set of product variants to the consumer and let us say that these are all located somewhere here. So, O2, who probably is somewhere here. And similarly, each one of them have a dimension on attribute one and something on attribute two, each one of them have a value on attribute one and some value on attribute two. Now, what is the goal of conjoint analysis? The goal of conjoint analysis is to look at product attribute data, ask the consumers their choices? So, here we are going to ask the consumer, do they like O1 better or O2 better or O3 better or O4 better? So, options, O essentially is for options. So, do the like option one, do the like option two, do the like option three, do the like option four or we can ask them pairwise comparison. So, between option one and two, what do you like, between option one and three what do you like? So, we are going to get that choices data, we obviously have described the attribute data and from there what is the objective of content analysis? The objective of content analysis is to first of all identify the weights, the importance assigned to attribute one and attribute two by the consumer. And second important objective was to identify the ideal option that can be designed or that can be offered to the consumer that ideal product or that ideal product variant will be something that the consumer would prefer the most. So, let us say that that ideal product is located at X. So, this is where the ideal product is located. Now, let us say that this ideal product, which is right now, not given in the set, or the coordinates of this is something that we need to find out. So, let us say that the coordinates are X1 and X2. Why am I using the notation X1 and X2? Because as I said, I am going to use the notation that were used in the original article. Here, I am not changing the notations used, so that there is no confusion, I am going to use the same notations used in the original article, I am only describing the method. So, they had described the optimization problem. But before we get into the optimization problem, let me explain that geometrically, which is what we are going to do. So, what is X? X is that ideal option, ideal option that needs to be offered to the consumer, why are we are going to offer this because we believe that this was going to be the most preferred option. So, they gave us choices, amongst O1, O2, O3, O4, we feel ideal product is somewhere at X. And X could be anywhere on this, X could be here, X could be here, we do not know. We do not know where the X is located. The one of the objectives of solving this linear programming problem is to find out the coordinates of X1 and X2. Now, how are you going to find, now, earlier we said we are going to ask consumers their preferences. Now, let us say that the consumer preferences are collected on pairwise data. So, I will say between option one and three, what do you prefer? So, if the consumer says they prefer option one over option three, if they say something like that, how are they going to say that, how are they actually saying that they prefer option one over option three? What are they thinking when they are giving me when the consumer is giving me some preference like this? So, obviously, consumer has an ideal point in mind. My objective is to figure out this ideal point, consumer has an ideal point in mind and consumer is then saying, how far is option one from my ideal point? Let me draw that or how far is option one from my ideal point, how far is option three from my ideal point, so consumer in her mind, probably measure this distance between the ideal point and each of the options that I am asking the preferences for. So, probably consumer does this. So, consumer says that d1 is the distance between ideal point and option one, d3 is the distance between ideal point and option three, d1 is the distance between option one and ideal point. Similarly, d3 will be the distance between option three and ideal point. Consumer never told me where the ideal point is, however, I do know the location of O1 and O3. So, I can find the distances only in terms of the ideal point, a coordinates of which are X1 and X2, but I do not know currently X1 and X2. So, I cannot find a numerical value for d1 and d3, I can find a mathematical explanation in terms of X1 and X2 because the coordinates of O1 and O3 are known to me. Now, after after mentally calculating the distances d1 and d3, what does the consumer say? You know what, option one is closer to ideal then option three. Option three is slightly farther away from the ideal for that particular consumer there is what consumer is thinking. I asked the consumer, give me your preference between one and three. Consumer is now saying okay let me calculate the distance d1, let me calculate the distance d3 and consumer is saying you know what option one is closer to my ideal, then option three is closer to that ideal. So, therefore I would prefer option one over option three, because, O1 is closer to ideal, which essentially means, that in consumers mind when consumer is giving some option like that consumer is saying d1 is less than d3 that is what consumer is saying. Consumer is saying d1 is less than d3, option one is closer to the ideal that means, it is closer, d1 is smaller, d3 is larger. And similarly, consumer does this kind of mental exercise every time I asked them to give me preferences for a pair. So, if I asked the consumer give me the preferences for the pair one, two. Consumer calculates, consumer has already calculated d1 and then consumer calculates d2, consumer calculates d2 and if consumer thinks that option number 2 is closer to the ideal than option number one, then consumer is going to tell me that she prefers two over one. In that sense, what is she saying ? She is telling me that d2 is less than d1 that is what consumer is telling. Now, using all these preferences data, I know which of these inequalities are true and which are not true. So, if I know that consumer is saying one over three that means, I know that d1 is less than d3, I know that d3 less than d1 is not true. So, I know this and from these kind of choices data I have to figure out the value of X1 and X2. I also have to figure out when consumer is giving me this kind of preferences, are they looking at the X coordinate more or are they looking at the attribute two coordinate more that will tell me the weights assigned that will tell me the weights assigned to each of the attributes. So, is d2, d1 calculation driven more using attribute one dimension or using attribute two dimension. So, here I should clarify myself, I should not say distance between O1 and ideal point, I should say weighted distance. So, we are going to calculate weighted distance. So, that is the basic idea. So, what does this linear programming problem do? Linear programming problem helps me identify this ideal location that is available only in the mind of the consumer. I do not know where this ideal point is, I want to figure out the coordinates and it is trying to find the weights assigned by the consumer to each of the attributes, using what data? Using the location of each of the options, I know the locations O1, O2, O3, O4. I know the locations. I also know the preferences, if I ask the consumer to give me a preference between one and three, consumer is going to tell me one over three that means consumer is indirectly telling me that for her d1 is less than d3, consumer is telling me d2 is less than d1. Consumer is telling me all this. Now using all this, can I figure out this, which is my objective number one, can I figure out this which is my objective number two that is what this linear programming problem does.
