Let us get into the mathematics of this. Let us define all the notations and formulate the linear programming problem now. So, what is the logic here? this linear programming problem is trying to understand individual differences in preference with a set of options. Now, what have we just noW defined, each product option is defined as a point in a multi attribute space. Now, we have explained the process on a two-dimensional data on a two-attribute data. Imagine this problem where the consumer actually has to evaluate product on seven different dimensions, nine different dimensions. So, anything even for potato chips, anything what are the ingredients, what are the flavors or what is the brand, what are the price? Price is something that is always an important attribute. So, the problem is never going to be on a simple two-dimensional two attribute space. The problem is going to be on multi attribute space which is going to be difficult to imagine geometrically. Therefore, we gave an example of only two dimensions two attributes, but the idea is still the same, every product option is going to be defined as a point in multi attribute space. Now, what we are going to do is so, here the subject means consumer. Each consumer has a different ideal point, a different most preferred location. For this particular consumer, we are trying to find out what is their ideal point. So, what do we do? We give them two options, and the customer is supposed to prefer an option which is closer to their ideal point which is what I was explaining d1 less than d2 or d1, d2 less than d1, d1 less than d3. So, obviously, they are going to give me choices, so that they give me option which is closer to their ideal point as a preferred location. Now, we also have to consider the fact that consumer sometimes may not even be completely rational meaning that sometimes we may find out later on that some of their preferences were not correct with their ideal point in mind with their weights in mind. Sometimes the consumer may have fumbled, because you imagine, consumer is doing all the inventory calculations when they are giving us preferences. And imagine the cognitive load on the consumer is not trivial, the cognitive load is quite high because they are evaluating this product on multiple attributes. They are evaluating multiple options, pairwise options of course, but multiple options being compared. So, sometimes there is a possibility that when they tell me that they prefer one over three, if they prefer one over three that may not always be true. So, sometimes they may be violated. So, we have to account for that also. So, as a measure of distance, we are going to either use Euclidean measure or weighted Euclidean measure. So, we have already decided that if we want to gather the weights assigned to each attribute, we are going to go with weighted Euclidean measure. So, let us get into the mathematical notation. The data that we are going to use is the same data that we had described in the previous session. It has four attributes, sorry, four options on two attributes. If you can recall, the data is the same. So, there are four variants that the consumer is comparing. Each variant is described on two attributes. And these are the values of each variant on each of the attributes. So, product two has an attribute one score of ten and an attribute two score of eight. That is what it means. And how is the consumer preferences data collected? Consumer preferences data is collected as pairwise comparisons, pairwise preferences data. And since there are four product variants, there are going to be one, two, three, four, five, six. Six pairwise options and I am collecting data on each of the pairwise options, each of the pairwise comparisons. So, how is this going to be? This is going to be four into three divided by two, which is why I got six options. So, this is n into n minus one, n is four, that divided by two which is six. So, I got six options and I collected data of on all the six pairwise comparisons from the consumer. Now, let us look at the mathematical notation. So, let us say that the options provided to the consumer is denoted by capital J, set J where J goes from one to n. So, for the n options, each is denoted on a P dimensions. So, P is the set of dimensions which goes all the way from one, two, three, four, five, six, t, up to t. So, the problem is formulated more generically using mathematical notations, we will translate that to our problem in the next slide. So, here we are saying that consumer is evaluating n options, each option is described on a t dimensional space. For each option, we have coordinates for each option on P dimensions. So, the jth option is on a t-dimensional space and the location and the coordinates are this which is what we described as Y11, Y12, Y13, all the way to Y1t for the first option, when J denotes the option and P denotes the attribute dimension. So, attribute number one value, attribute number two value, attribute number three value, attribute number t th value for the first option. So, the first subscript denotes the option number. So, these are the pre-specified locations I know this, so, these are my Y values, these are my Yjp values. So, what is this value here? This value here is the Y for product option number three, attribute number two. So, this is Y32, this is Y31 product option number three attribute number one. So, we have this data these are pre-specified. I know the location of each of these points on the t-dimensional space and the ideal point, ideal point is denoted by this xp where p is in this set. So, I am going to have X as X1 and X2. So, the ideal point on the attribute one dimension and on attribute two dimension this is what I wish to find out. Now, we have to allow these coordinates to be either positive or negative or zero, anything is possible. What does that mean? Even if the xp value is zero, that does not mean that consumer does not want that attribute, it only means that consumer wants that attribute at a value of zero. Now, whatever is the codification for zero, so, this is what we are trying to do. Now, let us translate that the problem data we have data for two attributes four variants and we have choice pairwise choices. So, what is n for us? N is actually four for us, what is p? p is two for us. So, let us do that. So, for us n is four, so, there are four product variants, one, two, three and four. There are two dimensions. So, t is actually two, so, p is one and two. And therefore, we are going to have specified locations on two dimensions for each of the options, so, Yj1 and Yj2. So, Y1 will have Y11 and Y12, Y2 essentially is going to give us Y21 and Y22. So, for each of the four options, I have their coordinates. These are the two-dimensional coordinates and what I wish to find out? I wish to find out the ideal point for this consumer as X1 and X2. Now the distance calculation going back to the geometric interpretation and now let us calculate the distance location. As we said generally, we are going to either use Euclidean measure or weighted Euclidean measure but we will go with Euclidean measure and you know the famous Euclidean formula for calculating distances. So, let us specify that just for the sake of completeness.
