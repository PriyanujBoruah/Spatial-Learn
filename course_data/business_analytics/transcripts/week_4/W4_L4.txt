Welcome back to the session on-demand response curve. We were looking at the relationship between price and demand. In the last session, we saw the relationship to have four properties, nonnegativity, downward sloping, continuity, and differentiability. We saw slope and elasticity to be the way to measure price sensitivity, and we saw two types of relationships. One was a simple linear relationship, and the other one was a relationship that maintains the elasticity in the linear demand response curve, the elasticity may not be constant. However, in a constant elasticity relationship, the elasticity remains constant, but the relationship becomes nonlinear, we saw that. We saw that the mechanisms for increasing the revenue may be different, whether we are dealing with a difference for an elastic product and it may be different for an elastic product. Now, let us continue with the further question. What is the analytics problem here? The analytics problem here is to be able to estimate a demand response curve. So, we can think of conducting an experiment in the market, where we offer different prices, and at those different prices, we check what is the realized demand at that particular time. So, for example, let me change this thing. So, I may offer a price and measure the quantity demanded in the market. So, let us say that for a particular product, let us not even give a specific product. Let us say that I offer a price of 3 rupees, what is the realized demand? If I offer a price of 6 rupees, what is the demand? If I offer a price of 2 rupees, what is the demand? If I offer a price of 10 rupees, what is the demand? Now, I do not expect the values to become negative because we are dealing with nonnegative relationships, nonnegative values. So, even if I say that the price is 50, I will say probably the demand comes down to 0, may not come down to 0 but 0 is the smallest value that I am going to observe. So, essentially, we want to collect this kind of data through an experiment. So, essentially, we will have prices offered and corresponding realized demand values. So, essentially, demand can be considered to be the dependent variable, demand is a reaction of the market, prices are the triggers for that reaction, therefore, prices can be considered to be an explanatory variable. Prices explain the difference in the demand values. So, prices can be considered to be an explanatory variable, demand can be considered to be a dependent variable. And let us say that from some experiments that we have conducted in the marketplace at a particular time, I have this data available. Now, from this, I want to estimate what may be the slope, I want to estimate what may be the elasticity. The elasticity may not be constant, however, if my relationship looks like a relationship where I have D is equal to C into p to the power of negative epsilon, I may think of having a constant elasticity. The slope may come in only when I am talking about a linear relationship. So, linear relationship. So, essentially, first of all, I may have to think about what kind of relationship I want to fit. If I want to fit a linear relationship between price and demand, I may be interested in finding the slope. If I am thinking of fitting a relationship where the elasticity may be constant, I may want to calculate the elasticity. I may want to estimate the elasticity from the data that I may have. So, the value of slope I am going to get is only going to be an estimate of slope from the data that I may have. I may not have the entire population values. I may have collected a small sample value of prices and the corresponding demand at those particular prices.
