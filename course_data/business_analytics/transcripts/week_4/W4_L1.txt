Welcome to the new session. In this session, we are going to focus on the relationship between price and demand through a curve called demand response curve. So, what is the demand response curve? So, generally the retailers are going to offer a price for a particular product or service in the market. Now, the market is going to react by realizing a particular demand at that particular price point. So, the demand response curve essentially tells us what is the realized demand at a price that is offered for a particular product or service. Now, why is this a business analytics topic? Well, the demand response curve itself is a to two variable plot price on the x axis and demand on the y axis price on the x axis demand on the y axis. So at a particular point, we keep changing the price and we keep realizing the demand at that particular price. So, today's session or a couple of sessions are going to focus on how we estimate this demand response curve. So, we are going to discuss various aspects of various relationship types between price and demand. And in general, the basic mechanism of this price and demand relationship through this demand response curve. So, typically, this is what a demand response curve is going to look like. So, we have this particular curve, a rough curve which is done like this, this is what we are going to call the demand response curve. So, what does it say? So, at a particular price let us say P1 this is the price offered and you hit the curve you look at this left and this Q1 is the quantity demanded by the market at that particular price point. Now, we know that we are going to adjust our demand based on the prices that are offered in the market. For example, if the price is P3, the quantity that is going to be demanded by the market is going to be Q3. So, every retailer has to decide what is the best price and let us call this best price as P star what is the best price to be offered for that particular product or service. At that particular optimal let us say optimal price point there is going to be some optimal demand realized in the market. Now, let us say that we make a mistake in calculating this optimal price and we end up pricing more. There is always a potential for the retailer to reduce the price which means go left to reduce the price and capture more demand because at P star the demand is going to be Q star, if we reduce the price if we reduce the price from P star to P1, the demand is going to jump up from Q star to Q1. So, this is that there is always a latent demand which is realized by this part of the region. This region represents the latent demand. How do we capture the latent demand? By reducing the price, by reducing the price we can capture more and more demand. Now, this portion of the plot represents what is called consumer surplus. Now, consumer surplus essentially is the benefit that the consumer gets by paying less and less price. So, if we are actually increasing the price if we are actually increasing the price from P star to P3, let us say the consumer surplus is going to be eaten away that much. So, this light blue shaded region is going to be the reduction in the consumer surplus that the consumer is getting, because the price is at P star and not at P3. If the price are if the prices are increased from P star to P3, the consumer surplus is going to consumer surplus is going to go down by this much amount by the light blue region. So, this is how the region is going to be read, this is how the plot has to be read as I was saying. So, this optimal price P star has to be very carefully chosen. So, if we reduce the price, there is always a scope to capture more demand, if we increase the price the consumer surplus may get affected we have I mean just like we are talking about consumer surplus we can talk about the producer surplus I mean I am pointing you to the basic economics course which is the slightly outside the current discussion on forecasting the curve, but nevertheless important for the discussion. Another important question then is if this is the price rate, if this is the demand response curve, how should the retailer decide this optimal price? What should be the objective of finalizing this price? Now, there are a couple of ways that we can go about. One is what is called as revenue maximizing price a revenue maximizing price every retailer wants to maximize the revenue the money that they collect from the customers of the product and service. So, that should always be a concern. However, we have to realize that maximizing revenue may not be the same as maximizing profit. So, there is a profit maximizing price, the price at which the profit is maximized, the price at which the revenue is maximized and we have to keep in mind that these two may be different objectives. Sorry, these are different objectives. We have to keep in mind that the optimal prices when we are maximizing revenue may be different from the optimal prices when we are maximizing the profit. How do we go about with these two objectives? Let us discuss that later. So, this is the basics of the demand response curve which is the blue curve which is pointed here. Let us understand the properties of this. So, this is essentially a function that describes how the demand varies as a function of price very similar to the demand supply curve in economics, however, this is for a single seller in a single market whereas, the demand supply curve aggregates various supply in the market and aggregates various demands in the market. So, this is slightly different from that scenario, where we are considering a single seller at a single time point in a single market. If you notice, there are four important things that you notice from this demand response curve. First of all, the demand for a product is always going to be non-negative, which means that it is always going to lie on the positive side of the y axis. You cannot have demand going negative. You cannot have demand going less than 0 does not make sense. Demand cannot be negative. So, the demand response curve is always going to be on the positive side. Similarly, you cannot offer negative prices, I mean, let us not get into the details, but negative prices would mean that the retailer gives money to the customer for using the product and services, which generally does not happen in the market. Therefore, even the prices are going to be on the positive side. So, you do not expect prices to go on the negative side. The lowest price is going to be 0. We are not going to look at a case where negative prices are even possible. So, the curve is going to be non-negative in both senses. The demand is going to be positive even if the prices offered in the market are going to be positive . It is going to be a continuous curve. So this is going to be a nice smooth continuous curve without any breakages without any breakages. So, for example, this is the price and this is the demand. You do not expect something like this, which means that you do not know what the demand is going to be between these two price points. So, what is going to be the demand? So, are we saying that there is no demand, but that also means that demand is 0. So, there is not going to be a discontinuity in the curve, there is not going to be a discontinuity in the curve. Very similarly, the curve is going to be very smooth and differentiable which means that tangent is always possible tangent is always possible at all the price points tangents is always possible at all the price points. So, the curve is also going to be differentiable. And unless we are talking about very specialized goods, that curve is generally going to be downward sloping. What does it mean? It means that as the prices increase the demand for the product reduces. There are certain products for example you can always think of Giffen goods. Examples could be luxury items for example, Rolex watches, Rolex watches sometimes if you increase the prices if you increase the prices, the demand for the product may actually go up because the exclusivity appeal for the product may go up. So, but generally speaking, we are going to look at goods whereas the prices are increasing, the demand is actually going to come down. So if the prices increase, the demand is going to come down and therefore, the curve is going to be a downward sloping curve, downward sloping curve. So, these are the four important properties once again, the quantity is going to be non-negative, the prices are going to be non-negative, the prices are going to be non-negative. So, it is first quadrant curve, the curve is coat and coat nice, which means that it is continuous it is differentiable and more importantly, we are going to look at a scenario where the curve is downward sloping the curve is downward sloping, which means that as the prices go up, the demand goes down, the demand goes down. So, these four these four properties are important. As I said, sometimes some goods may or may not hold but we are right now going to not worry about those kinds of goods. Right we are going to look at goods where the demand response curve is a downward sloping curve.
