[Music] so two ways of looking at how how we measure the price sensitivity uh how how sensitive is the is the demand to the price right so two ways of looking at it one is simply one is simple slope which is how much the demand changes with response to the change in price uh so it is essentially the change in demand demand at uh price point p2 minus demand at a price point p1 minus p ah divided by p2 minus p1 so it's a it's so essentially the delta in the demand divided by delta in the price right so very very uh simple uh uh ratio of change in uh uh change in demand divided by change in price right so as we know since the curve is downward sloping downward sloping if p1 is greater than p2 this means that the demand at p1 is lesser than demand at p2 what does that mean we go back right we go back let us go back so if so let us look at let us look at what is this point here this point here is demand at p3 and this point here is demand at p1 now we know that p3 is greater than p1 the price p3 is greater than price p1 and we can also see that demand at p3 demand at p3 is here which is q3 so this is q3 which is always lesser than demand at p1 which is q1 right so q1 is greater than q3 whereas p3 is greater than p1 so we know that right which means that this slope this slope if you define the slope it is going to be a negative negative value the slope is going to be negative value so we can we can we can look at slope as a local local estimator of change in demand for a very small change in price so very simple ah just calculate the calculate the slope of the slope of the tangent at that particular point and we will get the ah we will get the ah sensitivity ah for that particular price there is other way to calculate price sensitivity and that is called demand elasticity okay that is called demand elasticity so it is the ratio of percentage change in demand to the percentage change in price notice the difference notice the difference right notice the difference so essentially it is this is change in demand with change in price this is percentage change in demand with percentage change in price so you divide then the numerator by demand at p1 you divide the denominator by price p1 right so so essentially the numerator becomes a unitless quantity because you are dividing demand by demand so this the units cancel out the denominator becomes a unitless quantity because it is price divided by price so units cancel out so essentially unlike slope elasticity is unit less quantity it's a unit less quantity right uh so it is remember i let us define it again percentage change in demand to the percentage change in price right so percentage change in demand to the percentage change in price so for example elasticity of 2 would mean that a 10 percent reduction in price uh is essentially increases the demand by 20 percent right that that that's the meaning of this two so 20 percent increase so 10 percent reduction in price increases the demand by 20 right so we are we are talking percentages we are talking percentages in elasticity unlike slope where we are talking about change in demand to change in price elasticity is percentage change in demand to percentage change in price so that's the difference between elasticity and slope of the demand response curve now uh what do what what is the what is the general interpretation of elasticity there are certain goods which are supposed to be less elastic for example ah let us take the example of common salt that we use in our food now salt is required without salt the food is just not going to taste which means that even if the prices of salt go up i don't expect our consumption of salt to to change that much because salt is needed salt is essential quantity right without salt the the the food is not going to taste so i would expect the elasticity of something like salt to be much lesser right otherwise uh go to the other extreme ah think about uh think about a service like a holiday right a service like a holiday now uh uh holiday uh if the if the holiday is going to cost us too much there is a very high probability that we may change our plan right most of us may want to change our plan we may still go to our holiday but we may probably choose a different service ah reduce the number of days or do something but essentially react to that change in price so i would say that a holiday is a service where the elasticity is generally quite high right so here uh there is another thing that we have to look at is elasticity may also depend on time elasticity may also depend on time so there is a short term elasticity and there may be a long term elasticity so here here is here are few examples right so for example uh here are few examples of as i said salt for a product like salt for a product like salt uh in short term i need salt i just need salt right i mean there is absolutely no there is no alternative to that so for a for a product like salt uh the elasticity may be i mean yeah zero right uh i i just i just need salt that's it i just need salt uh for example on the other hand uh a two wheeler a two wheeler right uh a two wheeler i will say that elasticity is quite large because uh uh if the two-wheeler is going to cost me too much uh i will say ah let let me take a bus today let me take a bus today and not buy this two wheeler right so i i may i may i may look for alternate modes of transport at least in the short term at least in the short term i may i may look for alternates uh alternatives to buying a two wheeler so in that sense the the the short term elasticity of two wheeler may be much much higher than a short term elasticity for sure for salt now let us say that there is some emergency meeting that i have to attend ah there may be some emergency meeting that i have to attend and i just have to take a flight i mean there is no alternative i just have to take a flight i have to go attend a meeting i have to go attend to a personal thing uh i just need to travel so in the short term in case of emergency for example we may argue that even if the prices are higher ah if the if the demand requires i mean if the if the situation requires that i travel i will have to travel i will have to travel so pop the airline travel may have a very very uh low short-term elasticity uh movies right movies uh if the movie tickets are expensive i may postpone i may say let me watch tv at home today instead of buying a 500 rupee movie ticket or something like that let let me go to my friend's house right but i i may want to postpone that that purchase because i may want to find alternatives whereas for a salt there is actually no alternative right so in those cases i may expect a larger short-term elasticity but as i said elasticity may also have a time axis which means that the long term elasticity may be different for example for air travel now if i have emergency requirement i must reach there faster and therefore whatever is the price i may want to pay and catch that flight and reach my destination however in the long term in the long term if i have if i can plan and if the price tickets if the flight tickets are really expensive i may still want to find alternate mode of transportation and therefore in the long term airline travel may have a large value for elasticity so in the short term emergency cases i don't care if the price of the flight is uh too much i have to travel therefore i have to travel elasticity may be low in the long term if you allow me to plan my trip carefully ah if the if the price points are just not acceptable to me i may find alternate modes of transportation and therefore the elasticity goes up significantly in the long term for salt the elasticity may not change that much right because as i said salt is essential commodity salt is essential commodity so salt is essential commemoration it may go up little bit maybe i i will i will say that anyway eating up too much of salt is bad for my health i may cut down on the quantity of salt i eat however the the the margin that i have is is quite less therefore the elasticity may not change drastically as it would change for airline travel ah look at uh look at two wheeler on the other hand for a two wheeler uh today i go to the showroom and i say the prices of two wheeler is too much and therefore let today at least at least for a week time let me manage with alternate modes of transportation uh but in the long term if there is a demand for two wheeler there is a demand for two wheeler i mean really in the long term you really can't avoid so there are certain goods just wanted to show you that there are certain goods where the elasticity may come down over a period of time there are certain goods where the elasticity may go up drastically over a period of time a petrol is the example of later ah two wheeler as an example of former right so for movies movies uh uh i mean in general if the ticket prices are expensive i i may find alternate modes of alternate modes of transportation uh alternate modes of entertainment alternate modes of entertainment but uh i may still go for a movie in the long term right uh if you allow me to plan longer time maybe i'll buy subscription to one of the ott and i never have to go for uh movie theater right so the elasticity may go up drastically over a longer period of time right so that that's how elasticity changes ah depending on the goods right depending on the goods and depending on the time frame depending on the time frame right sometimes it changes drastically like 0.1 to 2.4 these are by the way examples we are not saying that airline travel has a elasticity of 2.4 in the long term right it may depend on it may depend on general consumer behavior right for some people airline travel may not be that elastic because even in long term uh i i i may not want to prefer alternate modes of transportation uh if i want to go for a movie i i once again 3.7 is not going to be elasticity for everyone in the long term right so these are just ah these are just representative numbers they are not elasticity values for everybody in the short term or for the long term but i hope i have conveyed the concept of elasticity depending on the product and services or depending on the time frame depending on the time access all right so just to recap we have looked at price sensitivity using two methods one is calculating the slope the other one is calculating the elasticity and we have interpreted both of them
