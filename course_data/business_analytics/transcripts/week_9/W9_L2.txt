So, let us take two inputs and two outputs. For this example, we do not have graphical output because we said, graphing will be very impossible to imagine more than 2 dimensions. Because remember, when we plotted this, we neglected the input, because we were only mapping the output when we plotted this. we completely neglected the output because there was only one output, which was the sales, and everybody was told that they must achieve sales of 10 lakhs. So, we were able to neglect the output dimensions here, we were able to neglect input dimensions here cannot be done in this case, there are two inputs and two outputs. So, every sales office is given some budget and the budget is not constant. They are given different budgets, they are given different teams, a different number of people in a team and they are told well try to get as many sales and as many leads as possible. So, even though the sales are not kept constant at 10 lakhs, we did not do that here. Everybody can achieve, whatever sales that they can achieve and several leads. So, this is a more generic case where there are more inputs and there are more outputs not a single input case with multiple outputs and vice versa. So, let us look at the formulation for this. Let us look at the formulation for this and once again, as I said, we do not have a fallback of graphical output here, we must rely on solving an optimization problem for each of the sales offices and check whether they are efficient or not efficient only from the optimization value and cannot verify from the plot because we do not have a plot. So, first of all, let us look at the formulation of the problem. Let us look at the formulation for sales office 1. So what are the I s and O's and X and Y's there are two inputs and two outputs? So, I11 input 1 for DMU 1, what is that? That is 3 lakhs 300,000. What is the second input for the first sales office 13? What is output 1 for sales office 1 it is 11 lakhs and 10,000? What is the second output for the first sales office it is 15? And what is going to be the decision variables input weights X11 and X21 they are going to be input weights, output weights are going to be Y11 and Y21 those are going to be the output weights. How are we going to calculate the efficiency? Efficiency for the first sales office is weighted output. So, weighted outputs so Y11, O11 plus Y21, O21 divided by X11, I11 plus X21, I21. And you know the values of I s and O's, you do know the values of these four because these four are your decision variables. These four are your decision variables. So, and so what is going to be the linear programming problem? The linear programming problem is going to be maximizing the numerator. So, maximize this and normalize this to be equal to 1 so that we do not end up having a ratio in the objective function, we are normalizing the denominator to 1. That is going to be the first constraint this is going to be the objective function. What are the other set of constraints using the weights for DMU1, none of the other DMU, and none of the DMU should get an efficiency of more than 1? So, E1 less than or equal to 1, E2 less than or equal to 1, and E3 less than or equal to 1 is going to be the constraints 4 and 5 also. Let us pick the efficiency of our 2. How is that going to be calculated? The data is going to come from the second sales office but the decision variables are going to come from the first sales office's choice. So, this is going to be a sorry output weight Y11, but the output value will be for the second DMU. Output weight will be first DMUs output value will be second DMUs. So, this is 22-second output for the second DMU. Similarly, weights will be coming from DMU1. So, I11 or sorry X11 but it is going to be I12 second DMU input for second DMU. Similarly, this is X21 plus our X21 multiplied by I22. I22 because it is the second input for the second DMU. Now, this has to be less than or equal to 1, how will we linearize it? We linearize it by taking the denominator to the right-hand side. So, we write the LP for the sales office as I said it is going to be maximizing the numerator which is disguised here as maximizing the numerator. And you know that the output values are 11 lakhs and 10,015 you know that we have already seen this, already seen this. Normalizing the denominator, normalizing the denominator is the budget and the team size. So, this is the budget value for sales office 1 this is the team size for sales office 1, and then the constraint, constraint saying that the efficiency has to be less than or equal to 1 for everybody first sales office reporting sale efficiency of less than or equal to 1. Second efficiency less than or equal to 1, third efficiency less than or equal to 1, fourth efficiency less than or equal to 1, fifth efficiency less than or equal to 1, using the weights for the first sales office, using the weights for the first sale office. And what are the decision variables? Decision variables are essentially these input and output weights for the first sales office because this problem is being solved by the first sales office. Does it make sense? You can go over this slide a couple of times to understand. Now, let us look at the Excel output. So, now, we have the excel sheet available here to us, is the data there are two inputs, budget and team size are the inputs, and there are two outputs sales and the number of leads. So, we have taken the full data. We are trying to formulate the LP for sale office 1. So, these are the input weights and output weights, input weights, and output weights. So, what is this value? This value is x11, this value is x21, this value is y11 and this value is y21. So, these are your decision variables, these are your decision variables. What is the objective function? The objective function, let us come here what is the objective function? The objective function is the maximization of the numerator weighted numerator it is already weighted. So, what is the objective function? Let us click that. So, output weights output multi-output weight 1 multiplied by output 1 plus output weight 2 multiplied by output 2. So, some product functions. So, this is going to be the objective function there is going to be the objective function. What is the first constraint? The first constraint is a normalization constraint, normalization constraint tells you that I take the input values input weight multiplied by the input 1, input weight 2 multiplied by the input 2, which has to be normalized to 1. What is this constraint? This constraint tells you that using the weight for sales office 1, sales office 1 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. So, this is the numerator which is the weighted output has to be less than or equal to the weighted input, weighted input. So, here it is the second DMU, the numerator for the second DMU, the numerator for the second DMU has to be less than or equal to the denominator for the second DMU using the weights for the first DMU. This is the third DMU solving its problem. Third DMU numerator, third DMU numerator, the weighted numerator and this is the denominator which is the input fourth DMU numerator, fourth DMU denominator, fifth DMU numerator, and fifth DMU denominator. So, let us solve this problem. Let us do it this time properly I will go to solver I will reset this let us reset this. So, let us solve this problem where is my objective function? My objective function is located here, what do I want my excel to change? My Excel can change these values. What are the constraints? Constraints, how do I add constraints? First is the normalizing constraint the left-hand side has to be equal to the right-hand side add this. And then all these guys have to be less than or equal to these guys. And then I will say okay I will make the constraints nonnegative using simplex LP and enter solve button. So, now, what is the result? The result is this DMU sales office 1 has a reported efficiency of 0.65, a reported efficiency of 0.65 and these are the weights assigned by this DMU to achieve this efficiency of 65 percent. So, by its calculation using its own calculation sales office, 1 is not able to report an efficiency of 1. We allowed the sales office to assign any input weight and any output weight, which by the way it is trying to do notice. Notice once again something peculiar for sales office 1, the sales look at the sales they are the lowest. They are the lowest sales office 1 has reported a sales of only 11 lakhs whereas all the other sales offices have reported higher sales. Sales office 1 is going to say you know what, this sale is all overrated. So, you should not assign too much importance to this, what do I mean by not attaching too much importance to this, the weight of the output weight should be as low as possible, what is the minimum value of the output 0. So, sales office 1 is trying to be clever 1 says let me assign a 0 weightage to output number 1. But even after doing that, it can report an efficiency of only 65 percent it is not efficient. It is not efficient and makes sense. Now, let us go to the formulation for 3. The formulation for 3 same data, data is not changed it is the same data, same data, these are the weights what are the weights first input third DMU, second input third DMU, first output third DMU, second output third DMU. So, these are your decision variables, these are your decision variables. How do you calculate the objective function? The objective function is the weighted output what is the weighted output? Output Y13, Y23 are the weights, and O13, O23 are the actual output values 34.5 lakhs are the sales, 12 is the number of leads generated, and 12 is the number of leads generated. So, that is your objective function which is maximizing the numerator. The numerator is the weighted output, what is the first constraint normalizing the weighted input normalizing it to 1. So, what is the weighted input? Input weight multiplied by the input for DMU 3, input for DMU 3 so input weight multiplied by budget, input 2 multiplied by budget sorry team size, the weight, and input value have to be equal to 1 so this is your normalizing input, normalizing the input. And now using the weights for DMU 3, none of the DMU should report an efficiency of more than 1 that can be written like this. So, now we are saying first DMU is the numerator, the numerator is the weighted output using the weights of DMU 3, but the data from DMU 1 is the numerator using the weight from DMU 3, but the data from DMU 1 is the denominator and this numerator has to be less than or equal to the denominator. Similarly, the second DMU is the output that will be used as they are for the DMU 3, but the value, the value of the output will come from DMU 2. Similarly, as a denominator, the denominator is input weights for DMU 3, but the input data for DMU 2 and so on and so on. So, if you want to still solve this let us solve this. Come here go to data go to solver already formulated let us hit the solve button. Let us hit the solve button and now notice the objective function value is 1. So, when we give full freedom to the third sales office to pick their input and output weights, they can report an efficiency of 1. So, using their calculations DMU 3 is efficient notice smartness on part of DMU 3. I have already always been highlighting this DMU 3 knows that the number of leads is actually on the lower side 12 is only the second-lowest. The second-lowest 15 is higher 23 is higher 20 is higher. So, DMU 3 knows that it is not doing that well on the second output. So, the best way to show yourself in the best possible light is to say that yeah, DM output number 2 is not the important boss number of leads is not important. How does that importance translate, importance translates to output weight very cleverly DMU 3 is assigning a weight of 0. You can keep doing this, you can keep doing this you can solve the DMU fourths problem DMU 4 problem, DMU 4 trying to solve the same problem, I will not get into the detail, but I can show you that DMU 4 is also able to report an objective function of 1. So, even DMU 4 is efficient. DMU 4 knows that it is the second-lowest in terms of sales, the lowest was DMU 1, and DMU 4 is the second-lowest in terms of sales. So, it is very rationally de-emphasizing that particular output. That particular output, the weight for output 1 is very cleverly assigned to 0, but whatever tricks that they play, they can report an efficiency of 1. So, that is how you find out which DMU is efficient and which DMU is not I have not solved all the problems that are for you to do. But from that solution from the 3 formulations that we have seen DMU 4 is efficient DMU 3 is efficient. DMU 1 however, is not DMU 1 has an efficiency of only 65 percent. So, DMU 1 is not going to be on the efficiency frontier. So, that is how you formulate the linear programming problem and solve them we have chosen to solve them in Excel does not mean that Excel is the only way to solve linear programming problems. But idea was to conclude the linear programming problems. And we have done so far three cases, a single- output case, a single-input case, and a generic case where we had more inputs and outputs. So, let us end the session here.
