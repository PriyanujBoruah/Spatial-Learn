Welcome to the new session on Data Envelopment Analysis. In the previous session using the graphical method as well as the linear programming optimization method, we saw how to identify efficient DMUs and inefficient DMUs. If you recall efficient DMU essentially falls on what was called as efficiency frontier. The efficiency frontier is the envelope. And all the efficient DMU, efficient DMU are the ones that have the objective function value of one after you solve the linear programming problem that we had seen in the last session. Now, in this session, we are going to focus on inefficient DMUs. The DMUs somehow did not find themselves on the efficiency frontier. Can we do something for them? Can we tell them what to do? So, first of all, we will identify, identification of these inefficient DMUs. We partially did that in the previous session. So, very simple, the inefficient DMUs are the DMUs that are going to report an objective function value of less than 1 when you solve the linear programming problem for them. Now, that you have identified the DMUs which are not efficient, can we do something for them, can we tell them what to do, can we prescribe something so, that they can also move towards efficiency. So, graphically speaking essentially we are telling them a path towards the efficiency frontier. So, we have, so just to summarize essentially the graphical output as well as the optimization problem, both are the data envelopment analysis methods even the graphical method was data envelopment analysis the optimization problem formulation was also one of the formulations of DEA. This is, so, there are other ways of formulating the optimization problem for DEA but right now, we have not discussed the details of those formulations. Remember we had discussed something called the BCC model CCR model. So, you can read about them on your own, but we have seen a basic optimization problem that when it is solved tells us which DMU is efficient and which DMU is not efficient. So, essentially, the inefficient DMUs are going to find themselves farther away from the efficiency frontier. Now, we want to tell them what to do. How can these inefficient DMUs become efficient? Graphically speaking, as I said, the only way they can be called efficient DMUs is when they move towards the efficiency frontier. So, they should move, they should move towards the frontier and if they are sitting on that efficiency envelope we are going to call even these DMUs efficient DMUs. However, the movement towards the envelope or the frontier is not vertical or horizontal. We will come to that. I will explain that in the next slide. But the movement of the inefficient DMUs towards the efficiency, at that moment, is neither vertical nor horizontal. Why is that? The reasons are once again technical. We have not gotten into the details of the economics of the data envelopment analysis. So, a lot of things we have skipped. So, there are things like scale efficiency, technical efficiency, and pure technical efficiency. So, SE is scale efficiency, TE is technical efficiency, and PT is pure technical efficiency. So, there are a lot of concepts that we have not discussed. For example, we have not even discussed the disposability of inputs and outputs. Typically that gets converted to what is called CRS or constant return to scale or VRS which is a variable return to scale. Now, even VRS has been further classified as DRS which is decreasing return of scale, IRS as increasing return of scale. All these are economic concepts that play a very important role in data envelopment analysis, but we have not discussed that we will be going further deeper into data envelopment analysis and we have kept that part out of the scope for the current discussion. So, summarizing, why is the movement of inefficient DMUs towards the envelope neither vertical nor horizontal? Well, it is not because of these concepts because of scale efficiencies, because of CRS, and so on. So, let us not bring those in right now, let us take that the moment towards the envelope is going to be a slightly inclined plane, what do I mean by all this? What do I mean by all this? Recall. Let us go back to the simple example where we had two inputs. Remember the two inputs, two inputs, and one output case. What were the two inputs? The two inputs were, I think, budget and the team size. Those were the marketing and sales team. So, hoping that more people you have on the team, hopefully, you can achieve more sales. And what was the only output? The output was the sales achieved. For this simple example, I think we had kept the sales constant. So, target everybody was told that they need to generate a sale of 10 lakh INR, and then we give them different budgets and different team sizes. So, recall that the graphical output of the data for 5 DMUs looks something like this. So, once again, the two inputs budget was an input and team size was another input. And if you recall, we are not going to get into the solution again. But if you recall, DMUs 5, 2, and 3 turned out to be efficient, which essentially means that when we solve the linear programming problem for them, the objective function values for these three DMUs turned out to be 1, 1 and we said 1 was the maximum efficiency you can get, because we had put a constraint that nobody should get an efficiency more than 1, that was a constraint. So, all the good ones will get an efficiency of 1. But as I had earlier mentioned, the focus of this session is not on the efficient DMU, the focus of this session is actually on 1 and 4, DMUs 1 and 4 which have been found inefficient. And why are they inefficient? Because they are not on the red efficiency frontier. So, for now, we have to give, now we have to find a method to prescribe 1 and 4 what to do. They are sitting there asking us well, I also want to become efficient, I also want me, I also want to be called as efficient, what should I do? So, they have to hit the efficiency frontier, the only way I can call them efficient is when they are sitting on the efficiency envelope. So, that is what I was saying. So, the moment, let us move them. So, I can move DMU 1 and say that well, if it simply reduces the budget. If it simply reduces the budget, simply reduce the budget, you are currently spending something like 300,000, reduce the budget, reduce the budget to about 200,000. And I will call you efficient because you will be sitting here, you will be sitting here on the efficiency frontier, and I will call you efficient. Similarly, for DMU 4 I can say that we will draw a vertical line, I can say that DMU 4 probably is, I do not exactly remember but DMU 4 is having a marketing and sales team of about 10 people, you bring it down to 8 people, and then you will hit that efficiency frontier, I am not being exact here probably I have to find out. But essentially, whatever number is a team size here, which is the intersection of this vertical line and the efficiency frontier, I will say move DMU 4 here, which means essentially keeping the same budget, but only reducing the team size. So, that is what I mean by this vertical or horizontal movement. Unfortunately, we do not recommend that in this method of DMU, the method that we are currently discussing. So, we are not going to say either move horizontally so that you are sitting on the efficiency frontier or you move vertically so that you are sitting on the efficiency frontier, but the idea is the same, I will call you efficient only if the DMU is found to be on the efficiency frontier. So, we have to tell DMU 1 and 4, how to move towards the efficiency frontier. And what is the basic idea? We are going to draw straight lines starting from the origin and we are going to say that, join that with 1 and we are going to say that I want DMU number 1 to move in this direction which is neither horizontal nor vertical. The vertical movement would have meant simply reducing the team size, horizontal movement would have meant simply reducing the budget, I do not want you to do either I want you to move in the direction indicated by the blue line. So, when you move the current input values to this new input value, DMU 1 is probably spending something like 300,000 dollars in terms of, 300,000 rupees in terms of budget, probably it has a team size of 13 or something, it looks to be between 12 and 14. And now, I am recommending that one moves in the direction of the blue line and hits the efficiency frontier here, which probably means that it is somewhere, I do not know, so somewhere more than 200,000 rupees but certainly lesser than 300,000. The team size is less than 13 but seems to be of the order of 10 or a little less than 10. And once it moves here, I will call DMU 1 also an efficient DMU, this point here is the result of efficiency efforts by DMU 1. So, this point here on a two-dimensional coordinate system, this point here, which represents the result of the efficiency efforts on part of DMU this is called hypothetical composite unit HCU, HCU hypothetical composite unit. So, a unit is just a decision-making unit. We have been calling these DMU. So, that is not surprising. Why hypothetical? Hypothetical because it is not present in the data as of now, the coordinates of DMU 1 up here, coordinates of DMU 1 are here. So, what we are asking is a hypothetical scenario, where DMU could be if it puts in enough effort to move towards efficiency. So, in that sense, it is only a hypothetical unit, the real DMU 1 is sitting here, this HCU is only a hypothetical situation we are imagining, if DMU 1 puts in enough effort, probably it can call itself efficient if it moves towards this unit, this hypothetical unit. Now, why is this called composite? Let us hold on for a couple of slides to explain that. And there is a definite meaning for that also, that is the reason that this point is called a hypothetical composite unit, and let us put a subscript 1 here, let us put a subscript 1 here just to say that it is a hypothetical composite unit for DMU 1. Very similarly, what is our recommendation for DMU 4? Again draw a straight line starting from 0, I mean, the way I have drawn it does not look to be perfectly straight, but imagine that this is straight. So, what is our prescription for DMU 4? How should DMU 4 become efficient? DMU 4 should not become efficient only by reducing the team size, it should not become efficient only by reducing the budget, only by reducing the budget that would have been a horizontal movement. Horizontal movement means a reduction in the budget, and vertical movements mean a reduction in the team size. We do not want to recommend a reduction of only one input. We want DMU 4 to show a reduction in both inputs. So, we want DMU 4 to move in the direction of this blue line and hit the envelope here. We do not recommend DMU 4 that it hits the envelope here, we do not recommend that. We want DMU 4 to hit the envelope here, which is the reduction in both budgets as well as the team size. So, just like we did for DMU 1, this point here is going to be called a hypothetical composite unit for DMU 4. So, this is our policy prescription for the inefficient DMUs, this is our policy prescription. So, we will draw a line starting from the origin and starting from the origin and connecting to the inefficient DMU and the point of intersection of this line with the efficiency frontier is our recommended new position for the inefficient DMU. So, we recommend that DMU 1 should move to HCU 1, and we recommend that DMU 4 should move to HCU 4, this is the graphical explanation of what we are going to do now. So, as this is just summarizing. So, DMUs 1 and 4 are inefficient. So, they have to move, essentially move meaning reduce the inputs. Here, this is an example of two inputs and one output. So, the only way that DMU can become efficient is to reduce the resources, reduce the resources that it is consuming, budget is the money that it is consuming, and team size is the people resource that it is consuming. So, reduce both of these resources. Only then the DMU can move towards the frontier. So, when they hit the frontier, that intersection point, this intersection point, we have discussed this now. This intersection point is going to be called a hypothetical composite unit and from the two- dimensional coordinate system for this simple example, it is very easy for us to identify this. How do we do that? Now, you already said. What is this blue line? The blue line is the line joining origin and DMU 4, blue line is the line joining origin which is coordinate 00 and DMU 4 and you know from data what is the coordinates of DMU 4, you know the input which is the budget as well as the team sizes for DMU 4 you know this. So, you know the coordinates of 4, you know the coordinates 00. Therefore, you should be able to find the equation of the line, which is passing through these two points, which is the blue line. We have drawn only a segment, but let us not get into technicalities, we should know the equation of this blue line. Similarly, you know the coordinates of 2 because the DMU 2 you know how much budget has been allocated, you know how much team size has been allocated. So, you know the coordinates of 2. Similarly, you know the coordinates of 3, you know the coordinates of 3. Therefore, the line joining 2 and 3 is this red segment. I am calling it line segment. So, yes, I am making a slight error, but it is for an explanation, you know what I am saying. So, imagine this has an extended version not only the segment, but you should be able to find the equation of this line which passes through 2 and 3. And therefore, HCU 4, which is a point here, can then be identified as a point of intersection of these two lines, the blue line as well as the red line. Now, let me explain the last missing piece, which was the composite. Why is the point called hypothetical composite unit? We have explained the hypothetical part because it is only hypothetical, we are only saying 4 could move to HCU 4 if it wants to be called efficient. We know what a unit is, a unit is a decision-making entity DMU unit. What is this composite? We are going to now say that inefficient DMU 4 can go towards efficiency, which is this point. Now, we are going to argue that HCU 4 is a composite essentially prepared from 2 and 3 because it is the intersection of the line, the blue line with the line passing through 2 and 3. So, this HCU is composed of some elements of 2 and some elements of 3, that is why this is called a composite unit. It is composed of some elements of 2 and some elements of 3. How is that? We will reveal that in a couple of minutes. I hope so far we are doing all right. So, we are arguing that this HCU 1, HCU 4 can be identified by simple geometry, because HCU 1 and HCU 4 are essentially the points of intersections of two lines, and the equations of these two lines we know already. So, let us do that. So, this is the final slightly better-looking diagram which shows the hypothetical composite unit for 1 and the hypothetical composite unit for 4. So, how are we going to find HCU 1 and HCU 4? Let us do that for HCU 1. So, the coordinates of DMU 1 are 300,000 and 13 which means that to generate a revenue of, to generate a sales of 10 lakhs rupees. DMU 1 consumes a budget of 3 lakhs and consumes a budget of 300,000. And it requires a sales team of 13 people that is what the coordinates mean. Now, this HCU, the HCU for DMU 1 is a combination of two efficient units and we already identified what will be the composite, what is the composition of this HCU, and the composition of this HCU will be efficient unit 2 and efficient unit 5. Therefore, for inefficient DMU 1, DMUs 2 and 5 are called the references unit, they are called the reference unit and the combination of these two references will give you the coordinates of the hypothetical composite unit for DMU 1. So, how are you going to find that? You are going to find that from point of intersection. And I leave that simple geometry to you, I will simply present the final result. And we can find that the hypothetical composite unit for DMU 1 has coordinates of 237,540 and 10.3. So, go back. So, what is this HCU here? This HCU here is 237,540 and 10.3. So, this is 237,540, and this vertical line here seems to indicate that it is. So, just above time. What does that mean? Now, what does that mean? What does that mean in the context of our DMU? Currently, DMU 1 is being efficient, is being inefficient because it is spending a budget of 3 lakhs and a team size of 13 it needs to bring it down, inputs have to be consumed less if you want to be called efficient. There are only two ways that you can be called efficient, either you produce more or you consume less, but those are the only two methods. Here we have fixed the output, the output is sales and sales, you have to achieve 10 lakh rupees of sales. So, you really cannot go in that direction, we are not going to propose that you increase your sales. So, the only way we are going to recommend is to reduce your inputs. And what is our recommendation? We are saying that DMU 1 will be called efficient if it spends a budget of about 237,000 and it has a team size of 10.3. This essentially means that DMU 1, if it wants to be called as efficient, it needs to reduce its budget from the current 300,000 to about 237,000, 237,550. And it also needs to reduce its sales team, which is currently at 13 to about 10.3. Now, let us not worry about the practicality of this. How are you going to have a sales team of 10.3? You can either have 10 or 11. So, let us not worry about that. Let us say that input 1 is reduced from 300,000 to 237,540, input 2 is reduced from 13 to 10.3. There are practical ways of arguing that way. So, you are going to say that if you want to argue with 10.3 in terms of the number of people in the team, you are going to say that there are going to be 10 salespeople who are going to be working on DMU 1 full time and the 11th salesperson is only going to spend 30 percent of her time for DMU 1, that is to explain 10.3. So, things can be explained. But the idea is not to get into the semantics of this, idea is to get the idea that DMU 1 can be called efficient only if it reduces the input and now we have quantified that reduction. It needs to reduce the budget from 3 lakhs to about 237,000 And it needs to reduce the team size from the current value of 13 to about 10.3. But this was the graphical explanation, point of intersection, draw two lines, you know the equation of the two lines because you know the coordinates of two points passing through the two lines through which the line passes, this is a very geometric explanation. Is there a more mathematical explanation? Can we use the optimization problem that we had solved for DMU 1? Remember in all this explanation, when we identified 237,000 and 10.3 we have not used the optimization problem. Can we use the solution of the optimization problem for DMU 1 in identifying this HCU? The answer is obviously, yes. So, how are we going to calculate that? Recall that the solution for the optimization problem for DMU 1, I had an objective function value of 0.792, therefore, we call DMU 1 inefficient. Let me show you that in Excel. So, if you recall this was the solution for the optimization problem for DMU 1. Why DMU 1? Because I am using output weights input weights for DMU 1, normalizing the input for DMU 1. So, I know that this is the solution to the optimization problem for DMU 1. So, what was the reported objective function? The reported objective function was 0.79 which is why we called DMU 1 an inefficient DMU. Look at DMU 2, when DMU 2 solves its problem it reported an objective function value of 1, therefore DMU 2 was efficient. So, DMU 1 reported an efficiency of 0.79. Now, what we are going to do is, we are going to look at the dual solution for this linear programming problem. What do I mean by the dual solution? Again, I refer you to the session that we had on operation research and particularly linear programming problems. From those sessions, you know what the dual of the linear programming problem is. So, and you also know how to find the dual solution from the solution of the primal problem, you know that. So, let me just show you that for DMU 1. So, this is the linear programming problem solved by DMU 1. So, this is our primal, this is essentially our primal. So, this is primal. Now, if you were to formulate the dual of this linear programming problem, we have already shown that this is a linear programming problem. No question about that. So, if we were to find the dual of this linear programming problem and we would have solved that dual linear programming problem, we would have obtained the dual variables. How do you find the solution to the dual variable, to the dual problem from Excel? You run what is called sensitivity. How do you get sensitivity in Excel? So, let me show you that very quickly, I have already solved this problem. So, this problem should already be there, already formulated. Now, if I hit the solve button I will ask for a sensitivity report and hit OK. Okay, let me do that sensitivity report will get published in Excel. So, Excel publishes sensitivity reports on demand, it is not auto-generated, we have to ask for it. What do I understand from the sensitivity report? Let us not. So, these are the values of your input weights and output weights 2.06 10 to the power of negative 6, 2.06 10 to the power of negative 6, 0.0293, 0.0293, 7.91, 7.91 10 to the power of negative 7, 7.91 10 to the power of negative 7, all these are your primal values, your primal decision variables, the x's and y's from the original DEA formulation. Now, you look at the bottom table and look for what is called Shadow prices. Now, shadow prices are the values of your dual variable, they are the values of your dual variable. Now, what was H9? H9 was our or H9 represent this, this equation represents the normalization of input. And you can see that it is a tight constraint, the left-hand side is 1, the right-hand side is 1, it is a tight constraint. The dual variable corresponding to that is our objective function, is our objective function 0.7919, 0.7919 is our objective function. The dual variable corresponds to the input normalization constraint. Look at all the other input variables, all the other dual variables, all the other input, and all the other dual variables are 0 except for these two. So, now you have a dual variable of 0.74, the other dual variable is 0.259. Now, what is this dual variable corresponding to? This dual variable is corresponding to cell H12. What was H12? H12 was this constraint. Now, what was this constraint for? Remember what was this constraint for, this was a constraint for DMU 1, this was a constraint for DMU 2, this was a constraint for DMU 3, this was a constraint for DMU 4, this was a constraint for DMU 5. What was the first constraint? The first constraint was using the input and output weights of DMU 1, DMU 1 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. What was this constraint? This constraint said that using the input and output weights of DMU 1, DMU 2 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. Similarly, using the input and output weights of DMU 1, DMU 3 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. Similarly, this constraint said that using the input and output weights of DMU 1, DMU 4 should not get an efficiency of more than 1, this constraint said that using the input and output weights of DMU 1, DMU 5 should not report an efficiency of more than 1. So, now, there are only two dual variables that are nonzero, this was the dual variable for the normalization constraint, let us not, that we have already explained. Now, out of these inequalities, these are all inequalities, out of these 5 inequalities, there are only two dual variables that are nonzero one corresponds to H12, H12 corresponds to DMU 2, and this dual variable is also nonzero and that corresponds to H15, H15 corresponds to DMU 5. Therefore, DMU 2, let us highlight that DMU 2 and DMU 5 are the only two DMUs and correspondingly only two constraints for which the dual variable is nonzero, 0.74 for the first and 0.259 for the second, this dual variable is 0, this dual variable value is 0, this dual variable value is 0. Therefore, we are going to conclude that for DMU 1, DMUs 2 and 5 are the reference unit, for DMU 1, DMUs 2 and 5 are the reference unit. Why did we conclude that? We simply looked at the dual variable values and these are the only nonzero dual variable values 0.74 and 0.259, 0.74 corresponds to the dual variable corresponding to constraint number 2, which was for DMU number 2 and 0.259 corresponds to the constraint number 5 which corresponds to the DMU number 5. Therefore, DMU 1, DMU 2, and 5 are the reference units. I hope that is understood. Now, from this optimization problem solution and these values of the dual variables we are going to carry the dual variable values which are nonzero, 0.74 and 0.259, 0.74 corresponds to the DMU 2 and 0.259 corresponds to DMU, not SMU, DM U 5. Now, we have identified the reference unit which is what we wanted. In our geometric calculations, that is what we did, we identified first of all, which are the reference units, identified which are the reference unit, and then we simply use geometry to find the point of intersection. So, far we have reached this point using optimization. Now, let us find the coordinates of HCU using optimization in particular we are going to use the dual variable values 0.74 and 0.259. So, let us go back to PPT and see these calculations already done for you, let me load the PPT. So, we have seen the geometric solution to identify the coordinates of HCU. Now, we have the dual variable values obtained from the optimization problem for the inefficient DMUs, we are going to use those dual variable values to identify the coordinates of HCU for DMU 1. Already done for DMU 1 using geometry let us do that using the analytical method. So, what we are going to do is, we are going to use what are called Shadow prices. And we realize that there are only two dual variables that are nonzero for the inequalities and those dual variables correspond to the DMU 2 and DMU 5 therefore, we conclude that those are our reference units for DMU 1. The dual variable values that we are carrying forward from that optimization solution were 0.74 which corresponded to DMU 2 and 0.259 I have rounded that off, 0.259 has been written as 0.26 which corresponded to DMU 5. Now, let us see the calculations. Let us use these dual variable values. What are we interested in finding? We are interested in finding the coordinates of HCU. Now, you will be able to understand why this was called a composite unit. For that, just like we did for the geometric method, we are going to require the coordinates of 2 and 5 which are the reference units. So, now these are the coordinates of the reference units. These are the coordinates of the reference unit 2. These are the coordinates of the reference unit 5. You can verify that from the data which essentially means that DMU 2 which is an efficient DMU is consuming a budget of 256,000 and a team size of 9 to generate sales of 10 lakhs. Similarly, DMU 5 is spending only 185,000 budget larger team size of about 14 people and it is finding itself on the efficiency frontier. Now, these are the two reference units for DMU 1. What are the dual variables corresponding to the reference unit? For reference unit 2 the dual variable value was 0.74, for the reference unit 5 the dual variable value was 0.26 this comes from the shadow prices which we just saw in Excel. Now, we are going to multiply this by 0.74 with coordinates of 2. What is the output coordinate of 2? Output coordinate, every DMU generates sales of 10 lakh rupees, so that is the output coordinate. So, 10 lakh rupees into 0.74 plus 10 lakh rupees into 0.26 will give you the output coordinate of the hypothetical composite unit. And we realize that 0.74 plus 0.26 this plus this is 1 and therefore, 10 lakhs into 0.74 plus 10 lakhs into 0.26 is going to return the same 10 lakhs. What is the implication? We are saying that when DMU 1 wants to be called an efficient DMU it still has to report a sales of 10 lakhs, that is what we mean by this. Now, the budget coordinate of DMU 2 was 256,000, 256,000 multiplied by the dual variable 0.74 plus the budget coordinate of reference unit 5 which was 185,000 multiplied by the dual variable value of 5 which is 0.26. So, 256,000 plus 0.74 plus 185,000 into 2.26 is going to give you 237,540 which should be the budget coordinate for a hypothetical composite unit for 1. Similarly, how do you identify the team size for HCU 1? The team size for HCU 1 is going to be identified by taking the team size for 2 which is 9 here multiplying that by the dual variable 0.74, a team size of 5 which is here, the dual variable of 5 which is here and you are going to get 10.3 which is the required team size for HCU 1. So, notice that this is the same solution that we had identified using the geometric method. This method did not use optimization this method simply said I know the equation of two lines find the point of intersection of the two lines and using simple geometry we identified 237,540 to be the budget and 10.3 to be the team size. Now, we have obtained the same values using an optimization logic, using the optimization argument, particularly using the dual variable values. So, what is our policy prescription? The policy prescription is the same. If DMU 1 wants to be called efficient, it needs to generate a sale of 10 lakh, it needs to use a budget of 237,540, and it is going to need a team size of 10.3 only. What is the current spending? Currently, DMU 1 is spending 3 lakhs, currently, DMU 1 is having a team size of 13, and using these two inputs, it can generate an output of 10 lakhs. So, what is our recommendation for DMU 1? Our recommendation for DMU 1 is to bring down the budget by about 62,000, reduce the team size by about 2.7, and then you will become efficient. Okay? Understood? Let us conclude the session by doing the same analysis for DMU 4. Recall what is an argument for DMU 4? DMU 4 is inefficient. Our recommendation is it moves along the blue dotted line and comes here. Once again you can solve this problem geometrically, point of intersection, blue dotted line, and solid red line are intersecting at that HCU 4. And therefore, finding the coordinates of HCU 4 is easy geometrically. But you realize that this geometry is easy when you have a nice two-dimensional plot like what we have on the slide here, where we only had two inputs, we only had one output and that output was fixed. We are not going to have this kind of luxury of these easy calculations, in reality, in reality, you are going to have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and therefore we cannot rely on the graphical method, you cannot rely on the geometry. So, let us do the same calculations but instead of that, instead of using geometry, let us use optimization and calculate the coordinates of HCU 4. As we saw when we use the dual variable and the reference units, we do not need geometry. So, let us do that. Let us go to Excel first. Let us look at the DMU 4. Why was DMU 4 inefficient? DMU 4 was inefficient because when it solved its own DEA in your programming DEA, it reported an objective function of 0.84. It reported an objective function of 0.84 therefore DMU 4 is inefficient. Now, once again let us run the sensitivity let us get the sensitivity report for DMU 4. You have already seen how to get that sensitivity report, I already have that generated for you. I am not going to do that again. So, this is the sensitivity report for DMU 4. Make sure that it matches. What is the input weight? 6.21 10 to the power of negative 7, you think this is a different number. So, the same number, they are not different numbers, this is second input weight is 0.075, 0.075 the output weight is 8.4 10 to the power of negative 7, 8.4 10 to the power of negative 7. So, it is the same solution. So, this is the sensitivity report for DMU 4, this is not of interest to us, we have already seen that. This is of less importance to us because I can already get the final value of the decision variables from here. There are the primal decision variables. Now, we are interested in finding the decision variables of the dual which are called Shadow prices in Excel. What does this 0.84 correspond to? 0.84 corresponds to H9. H9 is our normalization of input. So, the dual variable corresponding to the normalization of inputs is our objective function value of 0.84. Now, out of the inequalities, this was an inequality, normalization of input was inequality, out of the inequalities, there are going to be five inequalities one corresponding to each of the DMUs. So, I am not going to repeat what each of these inequalities corresponds to, they are essentially saying that using the input and output weights of DMU 4, none of the DMU should report an efficiency of more than 1, for these five inequalities, these are the only two dual variables which are non zero. Other than that this is 0, this is 0, this is 0. This 0.7 corresponds to H12, what is H12? H12 in this, H12 is this. So, this is the DMU. Similarly, 0.29 is the dual variable corresponding to the constraint H13, H13 corresponds to which DMU, H13 corresponds to DMU 3, and H13 corresponds to DMU 3. Therefore, we are going to conclude that DMU 4, the first of all we are going to conclude that DMU 4 is inefficient. For DMU 4, DMU 2 and 3 are reference units, DMU 2 and 3 are reference units, and DMU 2 and 3 are reference units. Now, using the same method that we had employed for DMU 1, we are going to calculate the coordinates of HCU for DMU 4. Let us quickly check what the dual variables are. Dual variables are 0.74 and 0.295. If you notice, if you add up, if you say this plus this it is going to add up to 1, just like it added up for this. This was also 0.74 plus 0.259 was 1. It is going to add up to 1 always. Now, 0.74 and 0.295 are the dual variables we are going to take for our calculation, let us go to Excel again. Let us go to PPT again. This time we are interested in finding the coordinates of HCU 4. We already identified that DMU 4 DMU 2 and DMU 3 were the reference units. From the data that was earlier given to you, you can verify that for DMU 2 the coordinates were 256 and 9. Well, you need not have to go to the original data you could see that from here itself, for DMU 2 these are the coordinates, for DMU 3 was spending a budget of 5 lakhs, it was using a team of 7 people and it was generating a sales of 10 lakhs. So, those were the coordinates of 3. What were the dual variable values corresponding to 2? The dual variable value corresponding to 2 was 0.705, and the dual variable corresponding to 3 was 0.295. Now, same calculations, 10 lakhs is the sales for DMU 2 multiplied by the dual weight, dual variable value 0.705. The sales for DMU 3 were 10 lakhs. The dual variable is 0.295, 10 lakhs multiplied by 0.705 plus 10 lakhs multiplied by 0.295 is going to give you 10 lakhs which is output which is sales, the budget 256,000 for DMU 2 multiplied by the dual variable for DMU 2 plus the budget for DMU 3 and the dual variable value for DMU 3. So, 256,000 multiplied by 0.7 plus 500,000 multiplied by 295 is going to give you this value of 327,980. Similarly, the team size 9, 9 multiplied by the dual variable value, 7 multiplied by the dual variable value is going to give you the coordinates of HCU 4. So, using the dual variable values, you are going to calculate the coordinates of HCU 4. So, what are the coordinates of HCU 4? Let us go and look at that. So, what are the coordinates? This is 327,000 something 980 and the team size was I think 8.4. What does that mean? That means if your draw a vertical line, this is going to be that 327,000 and if you draw the horizontal line it is going to set just above 8, 8.4. There are going to be the coordinates of HCU 4. So, how should DMU 4 become efficient? DMU 4 should become efficient by spending a budget of about 327,000 using a team size of about 8.41. But what is it doing currently? Currently, it is spending a budget of 390,000. It is using a team size of 10. So, what is our recommendation? What is our recommendation for DMU 4? Our recommendation for DMU 4 is to reduce the budget by 62,000 and reduce the team size by about 1.6. If it does that, it is going to move from its current location along the blue line and it is going to sit on that red efficiency envelop and then anybody will be forced to call DMU 4 also as efficient DMU because at that time it would be sitting on an efficiency frontier, that is how you prescribe action items for inefficient DMUs so that they can become efficient DMUs. What is the key? The key here is to use the dual variable values that can be obtained by solving the optimization problem. We saw that geometry can help, but geometry can help only in simple examples like the one that is presented here. More generically, we are going to use the dual variable values to find the coordinates of the hypothetical composite unit. Once again, to highlight why was that called hypothetical composite unit, it was called composite unit because it is composed of 2 and 3. We used 70 percent of 2, and 29 percent of 3, and we got the hypothetical composite unit for 4. Here we used 74 percent of DMU 2, 26 percent of DMU 5 and we got the hypothetical composite unit for 1. That is why it is called a composite unit, it consists of two efficient DMUs. One last comment before we end. Where can we use DMUs or DEA? Where can we use data envelopment analysis? Data envelopment analysis is fairly obvious, it can be used when we have data about various decision-making units and we want to find which of these decision-making units are efficient, and which are not efficient. So, let me spend the last 1 minute in self-promotion. I hope you do not mind me promoting myself. We did an analysis and I am showing you an article that we wrote some time ago where we looked at MGNREGA implementation. MGNREGA is the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. We looked at the rural guarantee scheme and looked at various states that try to implement MGNREGA. So, they have various inputs, they have various outputs. And we looked at which state is efficiently implementing MGNREGA, and which state is not efficiently implementing MGNREGA, this was all done using publicly available data. And we use DEA and found out which states are efficient, and which states are not efficient. More importantly, we were able to have policy prescriptions for states that were found to be inefficient. And we were able to tell them what they should be doing. So, they can also be called efficient states implementing MGNREGA. So, with that concluding remark let me end the session. Thank you.
