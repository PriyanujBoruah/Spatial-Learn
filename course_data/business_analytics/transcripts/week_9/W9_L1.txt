If this is clear then let us go to the other example that we had taken in the graphical method. Which was the case, where we had two outputs and a single input. So, now, every sales office has a budget of 2 lakhs, which was the only input. But they must achieve whatever sales that they can achieve and generate potential leads. We have described what potential leads mean. So, this was the data, this was the data that we had used for this case where we have two outputs, sales is the output, the number of leads is the output and only a single input which is the budget. And actually, it is the same for all the DMUs it is the same for all the five DMUs, all the five sales offices. How would we formulate such a problem? First of all, let us understand the o's and i s then the x s and y's. How do you interpret the o's and i s? Let us look at this problem as a problem for sales office 1. So, what is O11? O11 is the first output for sales office 1, that value is 11 lakhs and 10,000. What is the second output for the first sales office? That value is 15? O21. Similarly, the only input, input number 1 for sales of is 1 that value is sorry, 11 that value is 2 lakhs. Did I have an extra 0 there? No. So, those are the a's and o s and i s. Since we have one input, we are going to need only one input weight. Since there are two outputs we are going to need two output weights. Next, is, what is mentioned here. So, for every sales office, we are going to have two outputs O1k and O2k, k represents the DMU. So, keep replacing K with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, you will get the different output values and these are the weights. X 1k, so X1 1, X1 2, X1 3, X1 4, X1 5 will be the input weights used by each of the DMUs. And this pair of Y 1k and Y 2k is going to be the output weights used by the DMU k. You change DMU k to, k to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you are going to get the different variables Y1 1, Y 2, are going to have the weights for DMU 1, Y 1 2, Y 2 2 are going to be the weights for DMU 2 and so on. So, how would we formulate the problem? How would we formulate the problem? First of all, first of all, how do we define efficiency? Let us take sales of this 1, how do you define efficiency? Efficiency is weighted output, what is the weighted output? Here there are two outputs, here there are two outputs. So, Y 11, O11 plus Y 21, O21, Y 2 1 second output for first DMU divided by weighted input there is only one input which is X11, I 11. So, that is going to be the expression for efficiency. And how do you translate that to the linear programming problem? You say that I will maximize only the numerator. So, this will become your objective function, I will normalize the denominator to 1 which becomes the first constraint. So, let us do that. So, maximizing the weighted output is going to be the objective function, which matches with whatever we had written here. The first constraint is going to be normalizing the input, normalizing the input is written this way X11 multiplied by 2 lakhs, 2 lakhs is the budget, which is the only input that is given and we normalize this to 1. What is this constraint going to do? This constraint is not going to touch the 2 lakh because it is just a value. So, this constraint will ensure that we adjust the value of x 11 according to this constraint because this is an equality constraint. What are the, what are the other set of constraints? The other set of constraints is using these weights, no DMU should get an efficiency of more than 1. So, E 1 should be less than or equal to 1, E2 should be less than or equal to 1, and E3 should be less than or equal to 1. Let us take the example of E3, what is E3? Using the weights for sales office1, sales office3 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. So, what is going to be E3? Using the weights of DMU 1. So, Y11 multiplied by the first output for the third DMU. Y21 second output first DMU. However, the output value is going to be the second output for the third DMU, this is the weighted output divided by weighted input X11 is going to be the weight assigned by the first sales office for input 1. However, the input value I will use the first input I will use will be for DMU3. And then I will move this so, that this has to be less than or equal to 1. I will move this to the right-hand side and I will linearly write the constraint. So, this is that constraint, this is this constraint. Are you, do you want to ensure? The only thing that you have to check is whether O13 is 34 lakhs and O2 is 12. Let us check that quickly, yeah. So, this is 34 lakhs and this is 12. The right-hand side does not change because the input is the same for everybody. Input, there is only one input which is budget and the budget is kept constant at 2 lakhs for everybody. So, this is the constraint for the third sales office, this will be the constraint for the fourth sales office, 12 lakhs is the sales achieved, and 23 are the number of leads generated using the budget of 2 lakhs. And this is going to be the constraint for the sales office 5. This tells you what are the, what is the interpretation of this? It tells you that using the weights for sales of is 1 sales office 5 should not get an efficiency more than 1. We include sales office 1 also. Even when we tell you to maximize your efficiency, do not want a value of more than 1. Because of, an efficiency of more than 1, it does not make sense. So, we have written the constraints mathematically for all the five DMUs. The only thing to be done is to explicitly highlight the decision variables, what are the decision variables? The decision variables are the input weights and output weights. There is only one input weight x 11, there are two output weights y 11 and y 2 1, those are the two output weights and those have to be greater than or equal to 0, which is a typical requirement of a linear programming problem. Not always true, but true in this case. One more example is sales office 2, sales office 2, how will you, how will you formulate the numerator? The numerator is the weighted output that needs to be maximized, the weights are y 1 2 and y 22 output weights. So, first input second DMU, second sorry first output second DMU. Second output second DMU. So, these are output weights, y values output weights. So, maximizing the weighted output is the objective function. Make sure that these are the output values for the second sales office 17 lakhs and 10 leads, 17 lakhs and 10 leads, yes, 17 lakhs and 10 leads, 17.5 lakhs and 10 leads. Those are the output for a second. So, 175 and 10, are the output values. The input value is this, is the budget which is the same for everybody that has to be normalized to 1. Using the input weights input weight is X12, X12 because of the first input sales office 2. And once again these constraints are very similar only the input weight and output weights are going to be different, different from what we had here. Here we are the sales office 1 was assigning its weight, here sales office 2 is assigning its weight. So, the weights are different. The constraint structures are the same, and constraints interpretations are the same. Here the decision variables are the weights to be used by the sales office 2. So, these are the three weights, input weight and output weights for sales office 2. And we have seen in the previous formulation that every DMU uses different values for input weight and output weight. Because they will use the values that best suit them. So, very similarly, we have shown formulations of, for the first two sales offices. Very similarly, you can solve or you can formulate the problem for the remaining three sales offices. So, once again very similar approach let us go to the Excel sheet. Let us go to the Excel sheet, this is the Excel sheet this is the data for, this is the data for the two output scenarios. Two outputs were sales and the number of leads. So, let us look at let us go the other way. So, this was our graphical output, was our graphical output if you recall. This was our graphical output. So, yeah, and obviously, whatever we do in Excel LP should match the graphical output because the graphical output came from DEA. So, this was our envelope, the efficiency envelope. The efficiency envelope was on the outer side because we are mapping the outputs. So, the more the better, you want more sales you want more leads. So, the efficiency frontier is going to be drawn outwards not inwards, inwards is usually when you minimize the inputs. Here you are maximizing the output. So, 3, 4, 5 DMU3, DMU4 and DMU5 turned out to be efficient DMU 1 and DMU 2 turned out to be inefficient in the graphical method, graphical representation. Let us make sure that we can verify this, let us do this. So, I have already identified 3, 4, and 5 to be efficient. So, let us look at these three first 3, 4, and 5. So, let us look at 3 first. So, these are the, this is the data everybody gets the same marketing budget of 2 lakhs which is the only input. And there are two output sales and several leads. These are the values for each of the sales offices. That is there is only one input there is going to be only one input weight, and there are two outputs. So, there are going to be two output weights. Since this is the third change office solving the problem, how do you, how do you denote decision variables? So, this is input weight number 1, for the third sales office. Output weight number 1, for the third sales office. Output weight number 2, for the third sales office. So, these are your essential values. Now, do you want me to write them, write the constraint? Let us do that, let us do that no problem. So, this is our 1, third DMU. So, these are the output weights, output weight number 1 output weight number 2 multiplied by the output for the third sales office. That is my objective function. My first constraint is the normalization of input. So, input weight multiplied by the input which is common to everybody, which is the budget that is my, that was my denominator inefficiency expression, that has to be normalized to 1. So, this is your normalizing constraint. Now, what are these constraints, these are the constraints just to tell you that using these weights, using these weights, nobody should get an efficiency of more than 1. So, this is the numerator, the numerator is the weighted output for the first sales office, this is for the first sales office, first sales office. And this is the right-hand side, this is the right-hand side which is weighted input. Weighted input is input weight multiplied by the budget which is common to everybody. So, the right-hand side is going to be 1 for everybody here, the right-hand side is going to be 1 for everybody here. And this is this constraint tells you that using the weights for sales office 3, sales office 2 should not get an efficiency of 1. This constraint tells you that using the weights for sales office 3, sales office 3 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. If it is efficient, it can report an efficiency of 1 with no problem. Which is, what is happening here. It reports an efficiency of 1 left-hand side is same as right-hand side. Anyway, the constraint was less than or equal to. So, equal to is also acceptable. Similarly, this tells you that using the weight for DMU 3, DMU 4 should not quote an efficiency of more than 1. Using the weight of DMU 3, DMU 5 should not report an efficiency of more than 1. Then we do this nicely with a formula, initialize it to 0 and solve it and you will get the efficiency of 1 for the third sales office, for the third sales office. Now, notice a few things, anyway, we have not paid too much attention to the input and output weights, because we are right now focusing on who is efficient and who is not efficient. So, what weights they end up using matters much lesser but even then look at something peculiar. So, let me highlight that, sales office 3 decided that it is going to assign a weight of 0 to the second output, what was the second output? The second output was several leads. The second output was several leads. Notice that the third sales office has very few leads. Look at sales office 1, 15 sales office 4, 23, sales office 5, 20 leads. In that comparison, sales office 3, looks a little bad on that front. Only 12 leads were generated a huge sales were generated but only 12 leads were generated. So, very proudly it says I will deemphasize several leads, I do not think they are important. So, I will assign a weight of 0 which is okay, which is allowed for a decision variable, which is allowed for a decision variable, which is allowed for a DMU. So, we gave DMU the freedom to pick anyway, so why cannot they pick a weight of 0? There are some DEA formulations where the designer can say that no, no, no you cannot assign a weight of 0 you must assign some minimum weight, and some minimum weight has to be assigned. If you put that extra constraint then it will prevent a DMU from us from assigning a weight of 0 to a particular input or output. So, this is going back to the cricket analogy. If a bowler knows that, that particular bowler is not so good on economy, the number of runs on an average for over then that bowler can say no, this economy is overrated. I do not think that we should assign too much weight to this. So, I will assign a weight of 0. Yeah, it is okay. It is because we told the DMUs to assign the weights, that suit you best. Assigning a very large weight to this output when I know that I am not performing very well on that output. It does not suit me, so I will assign a weight of 0. Even with that or probably because of that the third sales office has reported efficiency of 1. Similarly, you can go to sales office 4, sales office 4. And notice, I am not going to solve, I am not going to solve, I am not going to solve this LP again, but you know how this is. This is your x 14, this is your y 14, this is your y 24. And by nicely balancing the input and output weights, even the sales office 4 has reported efficiency of 1. Even the sales office 5 will report an efficiency of 1. Sale office 5 can report an efficiency of 1. So, far are we matching? Go to the yes correct. So, 3, 4, and 5 have all reported efficiency of 1 and therefore they are on the efficiency frontier. They are on efficiency frontier 1 and 2. They do not seem to be an efficiency frontier. So, let us check their LPs, via programming outputs. So, the first sales office reported efficiency of 0.68, how did it get 0.68? So, let us look at this, this is x 11, this is y 11, this is y 21. So, this is weighted output, output multiplied by its weight. The normalizing constraint is normalizing the input. So, input weight multiplied by the 2 lakhs that everybody gets normalizing that to 1, normalizing that to 1. And these constraints tell you that using the weights, using the weights for DMU 1 and another DMU should report an efficiency of more than 1. So, this is a weighted output for a first sales office that has to be less than or equal to the denominator. Denominators are the same for everybody, this is the weighted output for DMU 2. As well as are equal to the input DMU 3, DMU 3. Output multiplied by the output weights of DMU 1 weights for DMU1, but the data from DMU 3 and so on. So, here we can say that, even when the first sales office had the freedom to choose any output weight and any input weight, the best efficiency that they can quote, the maximum efficiency they can quote is only 68 percent. And clearly, this sales office is not efficient. Very similarly, sales office 2 can report an efficiency of only 60 percent, 61 percent approximately, and 61 percent approximately. And even the sales office 2 is not efficient for this particular data, for this particular data. If you change the data, probably they will become efficient. If you pick different sales offices probably there will be (())(21:13). We do not know because as we said earlier, we are only measuring relative efficiency. So, go back and now we have validated that this graphical output was indeed 2, because this came from DEA. So, 3 4, 5 turned out to be efficient 1 and 2 turned out to be not so efficient. Hope this is understood now.
