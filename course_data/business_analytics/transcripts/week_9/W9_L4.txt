Welcome back to a new session on Data Envelopment Analysis. In the last session, we have seen how to deal with inefficient DMUs, and how to tell them how should they become efficient. And in general, what is the method of bringing them to the efficient envelope. The example that we had seen was an example where we had two inputs and one output. Now, let us take the reverse case where we have two outputs and one input we had seen in this example earlier. So, if you recall, five DMUs had two outputs, the two outputs that were considered as they were sales, sales and the number of leads, several leads, those were the two outputs and the input was the budget. Everybody was given the same budget of I think 2 lakhs for every DMU. And we saw using this budget, how much sales are they able to generate and how many leads are they able to generate. And this was the graphical output. And we have seen from the optimization output also, that three DMUs turned out to be positive 3, 4, 5, DMU 3, DMU 4, and DMU 5 turned out to be positive. The focus of this session is not on them, the focus of this session is on DMUs 1 and 2 and these are the DMUs that are not efficient because they are not sitting on the efficiency frontier. So, DMUs 1 and 2 are inefficient, we saw that in the background. So, we need to move these DMUs to the frontier. These DMUs have to move to the frontier so that we can call them efficient. And when they hit the frontier, what are we going to call that 0. we are going to call that 0. a hypothetical composite unit very similar to the approach that we had taken in the previous session. So, apart from that our two-dimensional graph, it is very easy to find the coordinates of HCU because what you are going to say is a similar approach to drawing a line from origin, draw a line from origin connect the 0. and hit it on the frontier, this will be the hypothetical composite unit for DMU 1, so this will be the hypothetical composite unit for DMU 1. Similarly, draw a line from origin, pass it through the point number 2 make it hit the frontier this will be the hypothetical composite unit for 2. And we already know geometrically how to find the coordinates of HCU. So, this is the same diagram drawn better not scribbling. So, we should be able to find the coordinates for hypothetical composite 1 and a hypothetical composite 2 using simple geometry. So, essentially, we know that for DMU 1, DMU 4 and 5 are the reference units, DMU 4 and DMU 5 are the reference units. So, we should be able to find the equation of this line which passes through DMU 4 and DMU 5, we should be able to find the equation of a line which is this blue dotted line that is passing through the origin and passing through DMU 1 and this HCU 1 is a point of intersection of these two lines are being strictly correct, we should say these two segments. Similarly, DMU 2, DMU 5, and DMU 3 are the reference units. So, we should be able to find the equation of this red segment which passes through 3 and 5, we should be able to find that equation. Similarly, we should be able to find an equation of a line that passes through the origin and DMU 2. And therefore, HCU 2 is a point of intersection of these two line segments, and therefore geometrically it should be easier to find the coordinates. Now, we can show you, graphically it can be shown that the coordinates of DMU 1, coordinates of DMU 1 are apparently by 11,10,000, and 15. This essentially means that using the budget of 2 lakhs or DMU 1 can generate sales of 11 lakhs. As well as leads, several sales lead of 15. For DMU 1, DMU 4 and 5 are the reference units. Now, 4 and 5 are the reference units, and using the process that I just described, you should be able to establish that the HCU the Hypothetical Composite Unit for one should have these coordinates 16,26,000 and 21.97. What does that mean in the context of our problem? It means that if DMU 1 wants to be called efficient, it needs to increase its output. This is only the example of two outputs and a single input. We are not recommending DMU want to reduce the budget. Everybody gets a budget of 2 lakhs, so no change there. But we want DMU 1 to increase its output. So, the output should increase from the current level of 11,10,000 to the new level of 26 lakhs and 26,000. Currently, the DMU is generating only 15 leads, to be called efficient it should generate 21.97 almost close to 22 sales leads. So, this is the geometric interpretation. What is the analytical interpretation? For analytical interpretation we have to go to the optimization output and just like we did for, just like we did for the two input cases, we look at the, we look at the objective function and we look at the shadow prices, we look at the shadow prices. So, I will take you to excel in a moment, but I can tell you that the dual variable values are 0.449 and 0.233. Let us go to Excel to see that. So, let me take you to excel. This is the Excel. This is the DMU 1, this is a DMU one, the problem is already solved, and the optimization problem is already solved. Now, DMU 1 has reported an objective function of 0.682 it is inefficient. I will look at the sensitivity report for DMU 1. And for DMU 1 two dual variables are nonzero, other dual variables are zeros, I do not pay attention to them. These are the two dual variables that are nonzero they correspond to L 14 and L 15. L 14 is this, and L 14 Is this which is for DMU 4. L 15 is this which corresponds to DMU 5. So, now we know that DMU 1, DMU 4, and 5 are the reference units. What are the dual variables corresponding to that? Dual variables corresponding to that are 0.449 and 0.233. But now we have a problem if you add up the two dual variables, so we will say a 0.449 plus 0.233. It does not add up to 1. However, there is a peculiar thing that we observed, it adds up to the objective function value. So, this value and this value are the same. So, the dual variable values, unlike in the two-input example, here, the dual variable values do not add up to 1, they add up to the efficiency value. So, how do you convert them? You do not take the dual variables directly into calculations you divide this dual variable by the objective function value. So, how do you do this? So, you divide the dual variable 0.449 by the objective function value, which is 0.682, and you divide the other dual variable by the objective function value, and you scale them to 1. Now, if you add them up, you will realize that it adds up to 1. So, once again, unlike the two-input example, you cannot directly take shadow prices, you cannot directly take the dual variable values in your HCU calculations because they do not add up to 1 they add up to only the value which is reported as the efficiency value for DMU 1. So, we need to scale these dual variable values and the way to scale them is to divide them by the efficiency value. So, 0.449 gets divided by 0.682, 0.233 gets divided by 0.682 and the scaled dual variable values now add up to 1. So, we are not going to use the raw dual variable values, we are going to use the scaled dual variable values to calculate our HCU. So, let us see that calculation. Remember these values now, remember 0.658 and 0.341. You do not have to remember 0.449 and 0.233. Remember 0.658 and 0.341 as the scale dual variable values and let us take you back to PPT. So, the raw dual variable values, the raw dual variable values are 0.449 and 0.233 but as we saw, they do not add up to 1 as they did in the two-input example. So, we have to scale them by dividing them by the efficiency value. And now we get the scaled weights which are 0.658 and 0.342, 0.658 and 0.342 for DMUs 4 and 5 respectively. Now, the method is very clear, we saw the method in the case of two input examples. So, how are we going to calculate the HCU, the hypothetical composite unit for 1? Using the scaled dual variable values, (())(09:32) very clear. We have seen that method when we looked at the two input examples. Now, we are going to calculate the coordinates of HCU using the dual variable which is scaled by dual variables 0.658 and 0.342. So, let us see this. For DMU 1, we know that the reference DMUs are 4 and 5. So, this is these are the coordinates of 4, these are the coordinates of 5, dual variables are 0.658 and 0.342. And how do you calculate the coordinates of the HCU? The coordinates of HCU, first of all, sales, sales are, sales value same 2 lakhs for DMU 4, 2 lakhs for DMU 5 gets multiplied by 0.658 gets multiplied by 0.342 you are going to get the same 2 lakhs. So, we do not recommend DMU 1 to change its input, input can be 2 lakhs budget used. The sales DMU 4 had a sale of 12,24,000 DMU 5 had a sale of 24 lakhs multiply that by the corresponding weights you get the coordinates of HCU for DMU 1 in terms of sales. Very similar to process 23 where the number of leads generated by DMU 4, 23, and 20 were the leads generated by DMU 5 multiply that by the corresponding weights and you will get the expected number of leads to be done by DMU 1 which is 21.97. Now, just to confirm this 1,626,000 and 21.97 are similar to what we got using the graphical method, using the graphical method 16,26,000 and 21.97. Here, we had 0.94, but these were just round-off things I did not round them off completely. So, we are getting the same values, the same value that we got from the geometric method. How do we interpret this now? Currently, DMU 1 is using a budget of 2 lakhs, DMU 1 is generating a sale of 1,110,000 and DMU 1 is generating leads of 15. Now, DMU 1 has to increase its output, increase its output by 5 lakh rupees in sales, and almost seven more leads to be generated only then we will call DMU 1 an efficient DMU. Hope that this explanation is clear. The only change that we have made from the previous session is the dual variable weights. Now, the dual variable weights are not the raw weights that come from the Excel output, we have to scale them so that they add up to 1 that is the only change we have made. Let us quickly look at DMU 2, let us quickly look at DMU 2, DMU 2 the referencing rates are 3 and 5, and reference units are 3 and 5. Let us look at the Excel for that, let us look at Excel for that. So, let me take you to Excel, LP2. So, this is the linear programming column for DMU 2, DMU 2 had reported the objective function of 0.60 which means it is inefficient. I will look at the sensitivity report for DMU 2. DMU 2 two dual variables are nonzero one corresponds to L 13. The next corresponds to L 15. These are the, two are the two dual variables that are non-zero. L 13 corresponds to, L 13 corresponds to do DMU 3 and L 15 corresponds to DMU 5. So, DMU 2, 3, and 5 were the reference units which is also evident from the graphical output. Now, what are the dual variable values? Dual variable values are 0.27 and 0.335. Unfortunately, 0.27 and 0.335 do not add up to 1. If you would say 0.27 plus 0.33, they do not add up to 1 but they add up to the efficiency value which was 0.609, 0.609. It adds up to the efficiency value. So, how do you scale the dual variables? You scale the dual variables by dividing them by the efficiency value. So, you scale it, you divide the efficiency, you scale the dual variable by dividing by the efficiency. So, 0.27 divided by 0.6 and then 0.33 divided by 0.60. So, your new dual variables the scale dual variables are 0.449 and 0.551, 0.449 And 0.551. 449 for DMU 3, 551 for DMU 5, let us go back to PPT. 0.449 for 3, 551 for 5. (())(14:22) DMU 2 we have seen that the references are DMU 3 and DMU 5, DMU 3 and DMU 5, these are the corresponding rates 449 for DMU 3, 551 for DMU 5. Remember these are the scaled dual variables and not the raw dual variables. The coordinates of DMU 3 are 34,50,000 and 12 leads. For 5 it is 24 lakhs and 20 leads. So, how are we going to calculate the coordinates of HCU for DMU 2? It is going to be the values multiplied by the corresponding weights, DMU 3 has a budget of 2 lakhs multiplied by the weight of DMU 3. DMU 5 has a budget of 2 lakhs multiplied by the weight of DMU 5. And obviously, DMU 2 is expected to have a budget of 2 lakhs, no change there. DMU 3 is generating a sale of 34 lakhs multiplied by the weight of DMU 3. DMU 5 is generating a sale of 24 lakhs multiplied by the weight of DMU 5. And therefore, this is the expected sales from a DMU 2. We expect DMU 2 to have a sale of 28,71,000 something. Similarly, DMU 3 generates leads of 12, 12 leads generated multiply that by the weight of DMU 3. DMU 5 has a lead of 20 multiply that with a weight of DMU 5 and then we expect DMU 2 to have 16.4 leads. How what is DMU 2 doing actually? DMU is consuming a budget of two lakhs, no change, same budget it is consuming. However, it is generating a sale of only 17 lakhs, it is expected that DMU 2 generates a sale of 28,71,000. So, what should DMU 2 do to become efficient? We are going to say that DMU 2 should increase the sale by 11 lakhs. Similarly, DMU 2 should increase the number of leads by 6, 6.4. It should increase the leads by 6.4. And that is how you calculate the coordinates of HCU. And once you find the coordinates of HCU, you can have a prescription for DMU 2. If DMU 2 asks us tell me what should I do to become efficient? Well, we can see from the table that DMU 2 should increase its sales, and increase the number of leads that it can generate. So, that is how you calculate the HCU in the case of two outputs and single input, the only difference being now we have scaled the dual variables they are not, we are not using the raw dual variables. And we will end the session here. Thank you.
