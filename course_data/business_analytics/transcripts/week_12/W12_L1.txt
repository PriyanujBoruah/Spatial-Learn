So, I wanted to kind of summarize this discussion that we have been having over the last 11 odd weeks, in the most generic way. If you recall, I had planned this, quote-unquote “conversation with Sandy” as the first session. And now I wanted to have a conversation with Malolan, Jaimini and Swami as the ending session. So, that is how it is being planned, more of a discussion, more of general interest and how do we go from here kind of a discussion, not meant to be going deeper in one of the topics that we have discussed, that is essentially left for you to explore. I mean, for the participants of the course to explore. And, I mean, yeah, there is really never an end to any topic, we can go as deep as we can. And if you go deep enough, probably you will earn a Ph.D. in that topic. So, that is not the intention. So, intention is to discuss the overall kind of state of art in this broad area called Business Analytics. So, what we have done in this course, is only cherry-picked a few topics and talked about it in the most introductory way. So, in that sense, it was a more of an introductory course. Content wise, there are enough resources available in the textbooks, even online resources are available, if you pick, for example, logistic regression, there are a lot of resources and extremely good resources that are available everywhere, textbooks, lectures, online courses dedicated to logistic regression. So, we can go to any depth, idea was not to talk about logistic regression idea was to pick an application and run it through a logistic regression model. So, this was only presented as application of these analytics techniques to specific business problems. If we see a related business problem where such technique can be used, we should now be able to use it, we should now be able to understand the fundamentals. That was the intention of our topic talking about these topics. But in general, we know that life never is easy. And problems do not come to us as a logistic regression problems or problems do not come to us as a one joint analysis problem, they do not come that way. We are solving a business problem and idea is we should be able to apply the most appropriate technique for it. So, any thoughts on this? So, I mean, many times I have seen this. The downside of this is, the opposite side of this is me becoming a logistic regression expert. And why do I say that it is a downside? Because then what will I end up doing is I will try to solve every problem using logistic regression, that is not the correct approach. Every business problem may need appropriate analytics technique to be used to solve. The idea is can we do this correct matching? This is the problem and this technique, this technique is the most appropriate technique to solve that problem. Can we make that connection? That is where the skill lies? Malolan: Sir, just a small, let us say a query from my end? So was this the reason why we saw visualizations in the beginning because visualizations are basically going to tell you what is the end result? So if you want such a result, then you can use such a technique? Could that be a link that he could have? Or not only presenting the information but if I want some output? I could think about it in this sense. So this is the kind of output I want. If I wanted output, mental visualization if I want that output, what technique will help me get that? Rahul: Absolutely. Malolan: Could that be a good justification for this? Rahul: Exactly, Exactly. Yeah. See if you recall Sandy's discussion, when we discussed visualization, essentially, what he focused on, focused on was asking the correct question, I may have data, what question I asked from the data essentially tells me what is the most appropriate technique. So yes, you are spot on. So visualization should help us understand what data do I have? How do I understand the data? And essentially, what do I expect from this and I mean, taking support from some of our discussion. So for example, for conjoint analysis, we solve conjoint analysis. So we essentially solve the same conjoint analysis problem using different techniques, regression optimization. So, depending on what questions you have in mind, the data can be used in a particular technique, and those insights can be obtained, that is the idea. But once you are, even before you get the data, even before you get the data, you have to have very clear objectives in mind. What is the objective what business problem you are trying to solve here? So, I would actually argue that even before data visualization, what data to collect should be guided by what questions do you have in mind? So, in fact, I have had this experience where one of the firms they have this whole data available with them. And simply because they have the data available with them, they want to use that data. And I have difficult time convincing them that if this is the question that you wish to answer, column number c, d, J, are not even required. And it is very difficult for them to get convinced. I say I have data, why do not you use it? So, that is, that is the challenge. So, even before visualization, even before we visualize the data we need to visualize, or as you rightly pointed out, we need to visualize what do we expect from this exercise? And then data visualization can help me understand what kind of questions actually can be answered from the data that I have, and I mean, that should get matched to my objectives. So, yes, I completely agree with you. Malolan: So, does that mean, that we should always have, let us say, the business knowledge about the problem that we are solving? Or can I go into something and then learn it on the fly? Would that make sense? Or should I always have, come let us say I am going to solve a marketing problem? So, I need to know the complete marketing domain before we start solving the problem? Or is it possible for me to say, talk to the business, understand what they want, then learn it, come back to them. So, which would be a better approach? Or, which would be ideal for? Because this is a question that always comes to the mind of students? Rahul: I agree. So, therefore, in my mind, and once again, we should ideally be talking to recruitment managers, but in my mind, this job title of business analysts, which is closest to the topic of our course, Business Analytics should be used by business analysts. So, in my mind, the business analyst is a person who needs to understand both the languages, they need to understand the language of business, and they need to understand the language of data science. So, ideally, this person to me is a person who can talk business when they are talking to the marketing manager. And they should be able to talk statistics when they are talking to the data science manager. So, this is the bridge, The Business Analyst should be the bridge. So, what should be the prerequisite knowledge? Well, I do not expect them to completely know marketing management that is not the job of a business analyst, they should understand the basics of marketing management. And as you said, depth can be picked up as you go along, I mean, depending on the context, depending on the problem that they are trying to solve. Maybe they can learn some problems, specific skills, so that they can solve the problem effectively. On the other hand, should they know 100 percent Statistics? No, that is not the job that a business analyst is expected to do, that is the job of a data scientist. So, they are not supposed to know 100 percent statistics, but they should know enough statistics that well, they can talk logically to a data scientists. So, then, in my mind, the business analysts are the bridge between the two important domains. Malolan: And I believe that is why during this course, we did not go into the mathematics of it but the application of these techniques in different problem areas. Rahul: Yes. Malolan: Thank you. Rahul: Yes. I mean, we were very clear that we do not want to teach statistics. I mean, that was very clear, and neither this is a out and out management course where we completely suppress the importance of data, that was not important. That was not the focus. So, I have had consulting presentations, where the manager that I am talking to, gently tells me before the final presentation, hey my CEO is not from data science background, so do not have any equations on the slide. So, I have had that experience. And once again, that was not the intention. We never shied away from putting up an equation where it was necessary, but the focus was not to get into the depth of that equation, use whatever is necessary to solve the problem that was the objective that we had taken in the course for all the topics. Hopefully, we have done, we have done justice. Swaminathan: adding to this conversation. So, this works in the industry in the following way. So, the students when they join industry, tomorrow, they will be given a problem. And what is going to happen is the stakeholders are not going to give them all the data that is required for solving the particular problem. So, what the students can do is to do a market research, understand what are the features or variables that could give us the optimal results. So, first after getting the data, so consider that as a sample data, do some analysis, and then do a market research on what more data can be added to increase the model accuracy or model performance. So, that is how we do in the industry. Rahul: Yeah, I am expecting industry to be a little more mature about this. And I see that they are using the right approach. I agree. Swaminathan: Again, the key here is to ask the right questions. Rahul: Yes, yes. Yes, absolutely. So, yeah, as I said, the topics that were chosen for the course, essentially, we were hoping that they drive important principles in this field. Marrying analytics to businesses, that was the principle, but I agree that we have not got gone in depth, not deeper, that was not the intention and therefore it was not done. But let me also tell you that more business focused analytics courses are coming. They are in the pipeline, your online BSC program team is actively planning for it. And you should look forward to it. And hopefully, you will see. Same team of Swaminathan, Jaimini, Malolan, Trivatsa, in those courses, also. So, yes, they are coming. But hopefully, hopefully this course has given you enough introduction, to be motivated and to be interested in those electives. Hopefully, that has happened. So, in general, now that you have been introduced to business analytics, how should you look forward to career in business analytics, in my mind, I have always thought of managers who have two kinds of jobs, once they have analytics background, you will be required to manage a traditional firm using the analytic skills that you have built up. For example, a traditional firm like Indian Oil, the main business of Indian oil is oil, it is not data. So, how can I increase the effectiveness? How can I increase the profitability of the Indian oil business, using the analytic skills that I have developed? That may be one of the reasons that managers may get hired? The other important responsibilities is on the other end of the spectrum, where you will be asked to manage essentially data-driven businesses, by data-driven businesses I mean, today's organizations like Google and Facebook and Amazon. Facebook, main job, in my mind, once again, is not to connect Person A with Person B, that that has been happening. But how do I, how do they effectively manage data and essentially manage this network of people, or network of organizations on the internet, I mean, that is the business. So, at the very core of it, I see data as the driving force for somebody like Facebook, I see data as a driving force for somebody like Google, Google cannot say that having a inbox on Gmail is their business, that is not their business, Their businesses, essentially data driven. I mean, the very first search algorithm, I mean, that Google was created with is a very important application of network analytics. So that is how I differentiate traditional businesses, from these data-driven businesses and analytic skills I am hoping are important for both of these businesses, traditional businesses and newer, new age businesses. But having said that, now, this is a question to all of you guys. So, now can I say that every organization today is a data-driven organization? What do you think? Malolan: Actually, sir, I am a person who got converted from the industry So, now look at this, as you said, there are two spectrums of industries, the traditional ones and the data-driven one. I believe in modern times, all industries are actually moving towards being more data-driven, they are slowly coming out of this. That is why you see a lot of job profiles, maybe on LinkedIn, or any other site that they say I want a business analyst, data scientist, a data engineer, so on and so forth all of these titles. So, I believe we are starting to move towards this spectrum of completely becoming data-driven. But how much of that is possible, maybe our friends from the industry Jainimi and Swaminathan can actually give a say on that, but how much is this possible for a company like Indian oil or a company, like any car manufacturer, Tata, Ford, let us say, Tesla, anyone? How much can they actually move towards being completely data-driven? That from a product kind of a perspective, from product industries how can they become completely data-driven? From the services, it becomes okay, but from a product perspective, that is maybe still a challenge, it will take more time. But everyone, like you said, everyone is now becoming data-driven, they want data to support it, no manager is now willing to see a slide that says you have to improve business they want you to show them how we want him to improve business, what rate at which you have to improve business what you are going into. So, yeah, I believe. Jaimini: I still want to add one point here. Say, in the traditional businesses, the traditional supply chains, we initially we use a very simplified supply chain, or a couple of players will be involved. But nowadays, since the era of globalization, a lot of players involved, a lot of subcontracting, a lot of outsourcing other things. So, I think in this data has helped to connect, to make to coordinate the supply chains in a more effective way. So, now a people sitting in say, US can manage business in India, or maybe the subcontract through, through analytics, ERPs, those things, they help to organize the entire business like putting together and next part is like, originally, we talk like, if the traditional businesses were actually it is not supported by data. So, we have a chance of more biasedness. So, he is calling the history, like, he used to have a king who was very good. But once the king is gone, his son is the next king, the king will put his own bias on own kind of decisions, which is subjective to him. So, that will actually make the life of people worse. So, we do not expect the scenario where the business is hinged with the wisdom of that decision maker. So, in that un-biasedness can be reduced with the help of data. So, we just do not make decisions based on gut feeling or based on our own personal wisdom. It should be backed up by data, then it will be like we have continuity in maintaining this organization, and will reduce their risk also. Rahul: Very rightly good. So, coming from a person who is the employer at some point of time had a name royal in their name. Jaimini: Yes, exactly sir. So, now we are also moving towards, the data-driven. Rahul: Yeah. Jaimini: Core Focus on data side. Rahul: Correct, so yeah, yes, Jaimini, Swaminathan: Oh, sorry. So, what is happening in the traditional business is the following. So, right now, there are recommendations made to managers, but it is their decision whether to go with a data-driven decision or go with their intuition based decision. So, right now, what is happening is analytics team is providing them with recommendations, but they have their own experience, which is unmatchable. Nothing can match human experience. So, therefore, right now, there is this mixed decision that is happening. So, on one hand, recommendations come from data analysts and data scientists. And then there is this experienced team who is going to decide what to move forward with? Rahul: And I mean, that is what Jainimi was alluding to. I mean, we are not saying that all intuition based decisions are bad, but there is a possibility that there may be personal biases getting introduced because you are relying only on your intuition. So, merging of the two, have data support and then based on your experience to take a decision. Malolan: Sir, just one small inquiry from you over here. So we are telling that businesses are moving towards data and that is what should be the case. But what will happen when you project something data that is counterintuitive? And the person has experience and he is not willing to accept that fact. So, that is a challenge that is for a roadblock in completely becoming data-driven. So, what would be a way forward in such scenarios if it is faced by anyone? Rahul: I mean, as an academician, I would always start by saying training, train all your senior managers sensitize them with the importance of data science. So, I mean, there are so many nowadays, I mean, data is never wrong. In God we trust, but please bring data. So, I mean, these are essentially pointers towards people becoming more and more sensitive to why data is important. So, I would say start by start by sensitizing everyone in the organization towards importance of data science. Start with that, however, there is always going to be this conflict between whether my experience is important or what your data is telling is important. And, I mean I am never ever going to say that experience is not important, as a person who has always studied data science, I will say that data science is very good. But that does that, what I say, does not essentially mean that your experience is useless. So, we have to find that sweet, sweet spot, finding that sweet spot is not going to be easy. So, more and more intuitions that drive your decisions have to get into formal analysis, so that our data science has looked at these things and still made a recommendation that has to happen. So, our data science algorithms have to become better. At the same time, the experienced managers also have to look at data science recommendations with some amount of curiosity and some amount of acceptability if I want to, if I can use that term. Malolan: So, then, for our students who are basically going to be business analysts future, they should also have discussion that, if they are doing something and some counter intuitive results are coming, they should also make sure that whatever they are done is correct or not the double-checking. This is something that as analysts, we see the data, this is what this comes out, and they start projecting it out. So, we should have that caution with us. So, maybe our learners can also be focused on that. So, before, even if you are presenting something, be cautious, though you have a data backing, they should be cautious about what they say, and they should be sure on what they say. Rahul: Yes, absolutely, absolutely agree with you. I mean, but you also have to look at the other argument, somebody once pointed out to me that, well, if the car manufacturers had looked at the trend, the customer trends, they would have kept on making faster and more powerful cars, and nobody would have thought of electric cars, I mean, so. So, I mean, you are saying a time series brand and you are saying I am completely looking at my data and therefore building my business, there has to be that disruptive thinking process that says, well, this is what data is saying, but I am saying something else. That in many industries that has proved to be I mean, really crucial in innovation. So, yes, that has to be respected. Right, so. Well, the question then for the data scientist is, can that data science engine provide this disruptive ideas, which is, right now creating the new wave of businesses, but yeah, I mean, it is not going to be as it is, it is not going to be easy, but we have to make sure that we are using every insight that we may get, that insight may come from our own experience, that insight may come from data that insight may come from anything else. So, somebody else's failure may teach me something, everything has to be learned, alright. So then what is the purpose of analytics? Why should we be studying analytics? Why should we be applying analytics? Traditionally analytics is classified as 4, in 4 stages, To answer 4 important questions. Our descriptive statistics tells us essentially what has happened for that I need, I need analytics, What has just happened, just to describe whatever, whatever has happened about that, about that problem? Diagnostic test is analytics tells me why it has happened, By the way, these two questions have never told me how to go forward, it is only telling me what has happened in the past. So, I am still describing the past. We are not talking about the future yet. But as always, understanding the past helps me prepare for the future. Therefore, these two questions are important. And Analytics does help in answering these questions. Now, predictive power of analytics can help us understand how to proceed, what is going to happen, what might happen in future so that is what I was saying. Time series, look at the time series. This is what the time series is up to so far, can I extrapolate the results and talk about what is going to happen next month, what is going to happen next quarter. So, that is the predictive power of analytics. But once again, this is still devoid of any decisions, we are not taking any decisions, we are only thinking what if the same trend continues what may happen, there is no intervention. The prescriptive power of analytics tells you what you should be doing, the prescriptive power is essentially what should you do next, this is what is going to happen next nothing is done, but what you should do what you should be doing, so, that you achieve your objectives and whatever your object are. So, analytics essentially should help us answer all the four I need to take better decisions in future but for that I must understand the past, therefore, I must know what has happened, why it has happened. So, those things are important, often I have seen even the practitioners of data science are discounting descriptive statistics saying this is trivial. But it gives you insights right, it does tell you a lot of important pointers that you should be keeping in mind when you are taking decisions. So, I would, I would argue against discounting even seemingly trivial things like descriptive statistics, simply quoting mean, mode, median statistics. It does provide information. So, in my mind, nothing goes waste, even simple things like Descriptive Statistics has a place. But these are the four questions that analytics answers, but I have always realized, I have always felt that analytics should not be for the sake of analytics, I mean, it is not, it is not a data exercise. The main purpose of analytics is essentially to make good decisions. And remember, we had emphasized on this point, even when we spoke to Sandy, when he was talking about data visualization, he emphasized why data science, good data science should lead to good decision making. So, the purpose of data science or purpose of analytics is not just to observe patterns or trends, but it is to make good decisions. Can my decision making capability be improved because I am investing so much on analytics. So, that that would be the purpose. In my mind, a manager's job is to make good decisions, that is why they are hired, that is why they are paid whatever they are paid. And, and can this analytics capability help me take better decisions, which is what we have been saying, what to do next can come from various sources, your experience, what the computer is doing, what my data is telling me what my boss is telling me, all that should essentially, is an input, the output is a decision. For unfortunately, the decision that I take is never, I never known to be good or bad decision. I have taken a decision. Hopefully, I have taken a decision with all the scientific methodology and no biasness and all that. Whether that decision will prove to be a good decision? Well, nobody knows. I mean, that is the uncertainty that is available in the environment, always, that good intentions may lead to bad decisions. But we just do not know. Therefore, we have to make sure that whenever we are taking the decision, we are using all the capability, all the analytical capability that we have. And hopefully, that decision turns out to be a good business. So this is a simple 2 by 2 metrics that I think can help us understand the role of analytics and decision making, Ideally, I want good analytics to lead to good decisions, And that is the ideal scenario. I do good data science, I provide good recommendations to the managers, managers act on it, those decisions turn out to make good decisions, and therefore that is the ideal sell. Now, if I am able to reach good decisions, even with bad analytics, then the fundamental question is, do I really need analytics? I am able to take good decisions even without using data science skills, or maybe that I am, I am not doing data science, correct. So, the managers intuition is beating analytics always. So, probably the, there is some error in the statistical technique that you are using. So, imagine if bad analytics is leading to good decisions, you should be questioning the analytics team, Do you really need them? What are they there for? On the other hand, if your data science team is doing a good job, but your managers are still taking very bad decisions, then you should be questioning the managers. Are they listening to the data science team? Or more importantly, are they asking the correct questions to the data science team? Because apparently, the data science team is doing a good job. We are still in this first row where there is good analytics, good analytics available for the managers to take decisions on. Managers are taking bad decisions. Therefore, the question really should be on the managers, are they paying attention to the recommendations made by the data science team? And obviously, very, very expectedly. If you do bad, bad analytics, I am hoping that it will lead to bad decisions. So that is, that is your karma. There is nothing else you have not invested in analytics team, and therefore you are taking bad decisions. So, that is, that is karma. So, that is, that is a quick link from analytics to decision making and back. Yeah, your thoughts on this? Swaminathan: Sir, as far as I am concerned, this is a very interesting slide, especially the text that is highlighted in the red. If you look at these four pillars,these summarize the entire course, we started with the dashboarding, which covered the descriptive analytics, and then we move towards the diagnostic analytics, especially the distributions lecture. So, we, analyzed why this is happening, why this data is following normal distribution or uniform distribution, and so on. So, we started with visualization, then a statistical test, and so on. And then we moved on to predictive analytics, topics like logistic regression, multivariate regression, and so on. And finally, we did conjoint analysis, where we are actually making a recommendation which attribute is most important to the customer, and so on. So, we cover all these four pillars in a chronological order in this course. So, that is what my finding is about. Rahul: Yeah, I mean, yeah. We did not plan it that way. But yeah, it looks like it does fit into the nice structure. Yes, Malolan: Sir, In fact, there is actually one more interesting fact here. When we look at two-part, when you look at topics like regression, so, what we are doing, we are doing diagnostic and the predictive analytics step, because our regression model and those coefficients are going to give us diagnostics about the data. Rahul: Yeah. Malolan: And we are then using some new data to predict our independent variable. Rahul: yeah. Malolan: So predictive, so there are, these are techniques that not only fit in predictive analytics, but actually have that beautiful flow of giving us a diagnostics, then doing predictive techniques Rahul: True. Malolan: So data science, most techniques in data science will actually have two or three overlaps that we that we have. Rahul: Yeah, technique may not be focused only on one. One question, it may be covering multiple questions to answer. Yes, yes. And that is how data science has evolved, I mean, now we are able to come up with good techniques that can help understand a lot of things at the same time. I mean, we should not be, we should not be doing this for answering this question, we should be doing this for answering this question and consuming. So yes, that is why I would always focus on good research in data science, that can help answer a lot of questions at the same time. But once again, I mean, the question should be relevant to a manager. This is a course on business analytics, I have to focus on business part, as well as the analytics part. So I would say every question that we asked must be relevant to the business. So and the answering capability must come from good analytics, that is where the explanatory capability comes from. That is where the prescriptive capability comes from. That is the good mathematics statistics. Alright, so, the main, not only of the slide, but the main message that I wanted to convey was the purpose of analytics is to drive good decisions, we have said this, at the very beginning of the course, we are making sure that we repeat this at the end of the course, so that the message is not lost on anybody. Rahul: Now the question, a completely different thought. Have the organization’s really changed over the last century, two century, I mean, any time span that you look at? My honest answer is well, they really have not and they really should not. Remember, Eli Goldratt’s famous book. What is that book? Swaminathan: Goal. Rahul: Exactly. What does the main character say in Goal, what is the single purpose for which an organization should exist? Exactly to make profits, organizations should exist to make profits. If you are not agreeing, you are not running a good organization, you are not in the right business. So, the purpose of any business is to make profit and therefore, it is well not correct on anybody’s part to expect the organization to change that goal, goal of an organization should be to make money. So, the core objectives, the core objectives have really not changed, have not changed, the organizations are still interested in making more profit, they should be, organization should always be interested in making sure that they reach out to as many customers as they can, they are doing that. Organization should always keep their employees happy. Some organizations have gone ahead and actually declared that employees are more important to me than the customers, we know that there is a famous Indian organization, which famously said that once, so and for example, some of the organizations are making sure that if I do not have infrastructure, I cannot serve my employees, I cannot serve my customers, therefore securing my infrastructure is important. So, their objectives are what they are. And I am happy that they have not changed. But my argument is the decision process of achieving these objectives have changed. Earlier, most of these objectives were met with minimal of data mining or analytics. Now most of these objectives are approached mainly from the data point of view. So, earlier, these decisions were made, earlier these objectives were always thought about, not that boards where board of directors were chasing same goal as 50 years ago, I am not true, they were still trying to chase the same objectives. But the business, the decision process was different. We did not have that kind of analytical skills. So, my submission is, organizations are still interested in the same thing that they were 60 years ago, 70 years ago. But now because the decision process has changed, it is more analytics driven. Now, what the organizations are trying to do is they are trying to mimic those decision processes using analytics that is my submission. So, really, I mean, you look at every domain of management, that the core principles have not changed that much, whatever has been put up on the slide, who will argue that, no, no, since the advent of data science, my main purpose is to use to analyze it, my main purpose is not to make money, no organization will say that. So, the goals have not changed, the objectives have not changed, the way we do it in testing. For example, if you take HR as a function, if you take HR as a function, I mean, this is an example let me give the, let me be completely honest about it. This is not an example that I have thought about, I have heard it from somebody I respect quite a lot. So, he always argued that well think of a shop, think of a jewellery shop, and you are the owner of the jewellery shop, you have some seven or eight employees working for you. You were always interested in hiring the best people because you are going to have only seven or eight people. This is a jewellery shop. So, you wanted to make sure that the people that you are hiring are honest, they are not stealing jewellery from you. At the same time, if you are in the jewellery business, if you are those very skilled employee who can make this intricate jewellery, you do not want to lose that person. So, you want to retain that person, you want to make sure that the person is happy in your shop, does not leave your shop, does not go to your competitor. So, you are still interested in these things, what were your ways of achieving that, you used to hire from people you know that will guarantee honest, I know this person is good, I know the family, they come from this or they come from my same village or we are from the same native place that used to ensure honesty. Now because of family ties, employee loyalty was kind of guaranteed. So, my family knows their family and my family takes care of their family or we are anyway friends otherwise, so that used to guarantee loyalty, employee loyalty. And since I know the employee very well, hopefully I can keep the employee happy and keep the employee in my shop. So, essentially employer knew how to manage their employees. But this was a small shop, which has only seven people, eight people. So, most of the decisions were taken because of smaller scale because of personal rapport with the family, because of family ties. So, I am trying to describe a scenario which informally uses data. So, I know, why do I know that the person is honest, I know the family. So, I am using some information not in the data form, but some information I am used. But now, the scale at which the organization look at the organization operates is completely different. And therefore, for example, to make sure that I get the employee with good skill set, I really cannot rely on my family ties, I have to rely on something like I have to rely on Naukri.com, to search for employees who fit my skill set. LinkedIn has become a very important recruitment site. So, employee profiling, the employee profiling cannot be left to these informal mechanisms, it has to be a very formal mechanism, which is what the new age organizations have achieved. Next is keeping the employee happy. For example, are they happy with me? So, attendance analytics, Performance Analytics. Some organizations also scan what websites my employer is visiting, I am sitting in Company X, my employer is constantly checking the website of company Y I know something is wrong. So, all these things have to be done in automated way. Cannot be relied on formal setups, cannot be relied on formal setups. So, these are all data driven applications now to essentially do the same function that earlier businesses used to do, quite informally, quite intuitionally. So, now, what the discussion that I was having is essentially are we replacing intuition with the more scientific approach, still same core principles, but now a more systematic data driven approach, I have one more example, employee turnover analytics. Will the employee go to my company? So, what is their average duration of stay? I mean, I have now told that coming out of the pandemic, apparently employee turnover is going to be a huge problem for many organizations. So, now, essentially, my contention is we are still interested in the same decisions in this HR domain, but now we are relying on analytics to take all these decisions for us without relying on these informal intuitional networks. Thought process, your thoughts on this. Jaimini: Sir actually, these management decisions, like what they have understood from whatever have been explained, so, in all the management decisions, we have to compress, one is the science part, one is art part, so which is like, so something which people learn, or they have some inbuilt personality based on that they will have the component. So, with the analytics, we just trying to make sure like that art part component is reduced. So, that anybody by learning that, based on this state decision sciences, they can make decisions. It is not like a personal attribute, is not a prominent factor in running the business. So, that is like, overall framework. Rahul: Right, going back to your king argument? You are not relying on the king to be the good hearted king. Any king can manage the kingdom. That is your argument. I agree. Completely agree with. Jaimini: So, generally, we used to have, like, in a school days itself, we used to see some shops, say like, small restaurant, maybe a dhaba. So, there, if the cook is good, then it will be accepted their business will boom. So, once it happened the cook runs away, then actually business fails down. So, we are trying to avoid that scenario, because the fortune of that restaurant should not be hinged on the cook always, so if I get a new cook also, he can maintain the same quality.
