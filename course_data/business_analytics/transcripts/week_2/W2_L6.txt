Welcome back to this tutorial on distributions. So, previously we saw two data sets. So, one was coming from a Poisson distribution and the other was coming from a normal distribution. So, right now we have another challenge we have a data set we will have to as usual guess the distribution do the visual inspection and then finally do the statistical tests. So, without any further delay let me show you the data that we have. So, as usual one, one column and this time we have around 51 observations and the data seems to be coming from a continuous random variable. So, we have 51 points as usual let us load it to python and then see what we can do importing pandas Numpy the excel file printing the data frame. So, 50 points let us do the histogram wow. So, the histogram you have one peak and peaks on the other side but it is not symmetric in nature. So, you have what symmetric in the sense that there is no stepwise decrease it across the center you have values on both sides but there is no step-by-step center point then something on the side. So, what you can basically say is again non-Gaussian symmetric somewhat symmetric but can we conclude something about it nothing more you can only say that it is somewhat symmetric in nature and it is non-Gaussian in nature. So, it could be anything it could be a Poisson it could be a uniform it could be some other distributions so on and so forth. So, that is all we can do from this particular histogram very true. So, till now we have not guessed anything we do not have enough evidence to make a guess. So, let us take a look at the descriptive statistics. So, the mean seems to be 54.92 and the standard deviation seems to be pretty low 2.65 interesting and median is also 54 that is close to the mean and this seems to be a I mean look at the minimum value and maximum value ranging between 50 to 59. So, this gives us some clue. So, here more than the minimum and maximum value what we should actually see is between the minimum and 25, 25 and 50, 50 and 75, 75 and maximum those intervals if you see it is all just around 2 right. And one more thing is that we have a mean value and the standard deviation of the variance is around 5 the mean is something the variance is very very small but standard deviation is very very small and it is symmetric. So, we were originally wondering it is it is a symmetric distribution but it is non-Gaussian so it could be some but from a sample we cannot completely conclude whether it is Poisson or let us say uniform but from this numbers you can actually confirm that it is uniform, uniform yes. So, because between the quantiles the split is almost same and the mean and in fact more than the mean the standard deviation is very very small. So, with the histogram and the descriptive statistics in this particular case we can say okay this comes from a near uniform, uniform distribution would be the best guess at this particular point very interesting. So, let us also look at these skewness and kurtosis okay the kurtosis is negative. So, what that means for me I mean. So, we don't have any concrete evidence about this. So, generally for normal distribution the kurtosis would be around 3. lesser than 3 I think it cannot be a normal correct, yes. So, the kurtosis is negative that is also reinforcing our judgment that it is not a Gaussian distribution the mean 54 the variance is only 7 and the skewness is 0.18. So, it is not skewed to either side it is centered and the variance is very small. So, we can actually say. So and looking at the split across quantiles which is also almost even a very low variance of good mean. So, we can say that I am the minimum and maximum. So, 50 plus let us say 59.69. So, let us assume to be 60. So, 50 + 60 by 2 is 55. So, 55 and the mean of 54. So, we can assume that this comes from uniform which is between 50 and 60. Looks like a solid guess let us see. So, as usual importing certain packages and then we are heading towards Q-Q and P-P plot. So, that is the Q-Q plot okay in fact show the P-P plot as well at this point once we are in the third tutorial we can actually discuss both together sure. So, P-P and Q-Q again is comparing the sample with a theorized uniform distribution that is why you have distance equal to uniform and it is almost straight line you cannot expect anything more. So, we can say our guess is correct it is a uniform distribution all right. So, now as usual we will formulate the null and alternate hypothesis null hypothesis says that the given data follows uniform distribution and the alternate hypothesis says that the given data does not follow uniform distribution. And so as you all know the mean here is 54.92 therefore I am using that information here. I am creating a new column in the data frame called df of expected and I am storing the mean value there. So, now if you look at the data frame. So, we have two columns column one is the observed value, column two is the expected value which is nothing but the mean right which is as smaller and explained it is the upper value less lower value divided by two. So, now directly let us get into the chi square statistic. So, chi square of the observed values and the expected values already. So, we have a chi square statistic of 6.311 and p value of 0.9999, that is huge. So, that is huge yeah. So, our null hypothesis is not rejected. So, we say that it is something it is coming from a uniform distribution we can stick to it and now the chi square that is statistic is alpha and your number of degrees of freedom. So, what is that going to be, so for k minus p minus 1. So, for p the p for uniform distribution is 0 because there is no parameter. So, you have the lower bound and upper bound. So, it is nothing but k minus 1 which means 50 minus 1 that is 49, 49. So, we just put that 66. So, our test statistic is lower than our chi squared stastical number from the tables. So, we can say that we do not reject the null hypothesis and we will say that this distribution this data is coming from a uniform distribution. And for those who are wondering what could be uniform in nature. Let us say any event that has a probability of happening let us say you are throwing a die it has six phases right. So, a number can happen with either 0 or 1 by 6. So, that is a uniform distribution. So, any event of that nature would be having a uniform distribution very true. So, the other example that I could think of is the fuel efficiency. For example you put one liter petrol or one liter diesel. So, every time you will get a different mileage it could be a 50, 52, 47. In case you are driving rash it will be very low say 40, 42. I hope I hope these numbers I hope these numbers are for two wheelers. If you have such a car let me know I will buy it on the way. So, we hope we will get better mileages. So, with this we will conclude this uh tutorial on distributions, exactly. And hope to see you soon in another lecture. Have a nice day see you guys, bye.
