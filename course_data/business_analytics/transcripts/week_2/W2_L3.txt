How good is this fit that is precisely called goodness of fit and it it is called goodness of it because there are goodness of fit tests. So, what are we trying to answer here through these goodness of fit tests what are we trying to answer we are trying to see whether the fitted distribution is good enough for the data what is the fitted distribution? The distribution that we are trying to fit. What is the distribution that we are trying to fit? We are trying to fit an exponential distribution what are the methods of doing that? Well you can use frequency comparison you can compare the frequency that comes from exponential distribution and compare that with the frequency that you have observed in the data set compare that if the frequencies are matching then you say that exponential distribution is a good fit. You may use what are called as probability plots and I have couple of examples in the subsequent slides those are essentially visual tools. They tell you whether the observed probability or observed percentile or observed quartile matches the quartile then percentiles that may come from the distribution. If it fits you will get a nice line if it does not fit you will be far away from that line a couple of slides later. Or there are very rigorous statistical tests called goodness of fit tests many of them use a Chi square distribution there are other there are various tests those are also described. Let us not look at frequency comparison that gets little bit technical let us look at probability plots. There are two kinds of probability plots we are going to look at. One the first one is called Q-Q plot which is Quantile-Quantile plot. So, Quantile- Quantile plot essentially compares the the Qth quantile of the sample distribution. Sample distribution is the distribution from the sample and the correct distribution is the distribution that is fitted. So, this indicates the distribution that we are trying to fit and this indicates the distribution that comes from the sample. Now if this x that comes from the fitted distribution matches with the x that comes from the sample distribution then you are going to get a nice line. So, you are going to plot all the x that comes from the fitted distribution which is called the model distribution and you are going to plot that against the x that comes from the sample distribution. Now if this x matches with this x you are going to get a nice 45 degree line in your Q-Q plot. Obviously this line is going to have a intercept of 0 and slope of 1. So, this this is going to be a 45 degree line and this is going to have an intercept of 0 obviously as I has been drawn it is going to have a slope of 1. Now let us very rarely I am going to get an exact 45 degree line. Most of the times I am going to lie around this line and how far away am I from this 45 degree line tells me how good is my model distribution how good is my fitted distribution. If I am very far away from this line obviously the distribution that I am trying to fit does not match with the sample. So, that is the interpretation of a Q-Q plot very similar slightly different however interpretation is similar but the concept is different it is called P-P plot. Probability-Probability plot. So, essentially for a given x I am trying to plot the probability I am going to plot the probability. P-P plot is applicable for both continuous as well as discrete data sets. So, I am going to compare F with F. This F is the model distribution this F is the sample distribution. Now once again if this x matches with this x I am going to have a fortified nice 45 degree line ah once again with intercept 0 and slope 1. Generally ah why do we need 2 different plots if the interpretation is going to be same I want a 45 degree line or the points around a 45 degree line? Well if the interpretation is same why do I need two separate plots P-P and Q-Q. Generally ah Q-Q plot will identify the differences between the tails of the distribution if the fitted distribution and the sample distributions are different in their tails that will get highlighted in the Q-Q plots. And if the difference in the distribution is mainly in the middle portion what are the tails usually for a normal distribution these are the tails and this is the middle portion of the distribution. So, if the model distribution if the fitted distribution and the sample distribution differ in the middle portion that gets highlighted in the P-P plot, if the differences between the model distribution and sample distributions exist mainly in the tail that gets highlighted in the Q-Q plot. Therefore we look at both the plots. Now what was our earlier decision for the 217 values we had decided to fit exponential distribution. Just for a reference point we are also going to fit normal distribution and for these two distributions we are going to look at the P-P plot and the Q-Q plot. So if we fit a normal distribution to our data. Now our data was called variable one and what have we tried to fit? We have tried to fit normal distribution what P-P plot does, P-P plot compares probability with probability. So, what is this this is the F from the model this is the F from the sample. So, the probability therefore this is going to be from 0 to 1 this probability therefore this is going to be from 0 to 1. So, on the P-P plot we plot the probabilities and how does the probability plot look like here. So, 0 to 1 probability for the observed I have made a mistake. So, this is not the model this is the sample and this is the model. So, and this is my 45 degree line and these are the observed points these are actual observations. Now do you think that the observed points are close to the 45 degree line well not particularly if you see the differences this is the difference deviation, deviation from the normal. So, the deviation seems to be particularly high I mean in this portion in the middle portion of the CDF there is a deviation, in the left portion of the CDF there is deviation, on the right portion there is less deviation but there is deviation. So, the deviation from the normal seems to be quite high in the P-P plots. Let us look at the Q-Q plot this is the P-P plot let us say this again. So, in the P-P plot the deviation from the normal seems to be quite high. Now what happens if you look at the P-P plot for exponential this is where we are trying to fit exponential distribution to our data set our data set was variable one. Now look at the P-P plot once again this is the sample probability this is the fitted or the model probability 45 degree line. Look at the observed points very very close to 45 degree line. So, exponential distribution seems to be fitting better than the fit for the normal distribution. This was the fit for the normal distribution, P-P plot fit. This is the fit for the exponential distribution obviously exponential distribution seems to be fitting well. Let us observe the deviations these are the deviations notice the scale though. This deviation may look large but this deviation of the order of 0.04, the deviation from the normal was quite large of the order of 0.15 ok negative 0.15. So, there are deviations from the exponential distribution P-P plot however the deviations are of the order of 0.04 negative or positive nothing more than that. Therefore in terms of P-P plot we seem to be observing that exponential distribution fits better than the normal distribution. Let us look at the Q-Q plots let us fit a Q-Q plot let us plot a Q-Q fitting normal distribution to our data. Normal distribution I still want to Q-Q plot Q-Q plot is going to have x values. So, x from the sample and x from the model which is from the fitted distribution. Once again nowhere close to the 45 degree line. Notice that this is the 45 degree line because on the x axis this goes all the way to 2. So, even though it may look like a weird line but it is actually a 45 degree line. Now if you only take up the take up to 1.5.What if we fit we a plot a Q-Q for exponential fit look at this. Very close to the 45 degree line there are some deviations here, what are these deviations for these deviations seems to be for higher observed values higher observed values close to 1.95, 1.96 towards the higher end of the values in the sample that is where the deviation seems to be. Once again deviation. So, even for the Q-Q plot we seem to be saying that exponential distribution fits better than the normal distribution. So, looking at the visual tools do we conclude that exponential distribution is a good fit for the data? Well it is definitely better fit compared to normal distribution but do we conclude unfortunately not. So, what is the last thing we look at we look at statistical goodness of fit tests. So, essentially what are we doing we are checking whether our data set are IID variables what are IID variables? Independent Identically Distributed random variables with a particular distribution that is our null hypothesis and there are two very famous tests one is called chi square test the other one is called Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Using these two tests we can actually check whether our data set has exponential distribution fitting very well to the data. Before we do that the test of independence has to happen we have to check whether they are independent values independent random variables. So, there is a separate statistical test for checking the independence and after you check the independence we come here and perform one of these two tests KS test which is Kolmogorov Smirnov test or a simple Chi square test to check whether the data fits or the exponential distribution with a particular value of lambda fits the data set very well. Let us stop here if you have any questions we will definitely answer all of them but this is essentially how we go about fitting distributions to any business data set. Obviously what will follow is we will take examples of various business data sets in multiple contexts and try to fit distributions to it. The last thing to be done before we close is putting the context. Remember I told you I kept this variable as variable one. I kept this variable as variable one without telling you the context in which the data was collected without telling you the units of this data. Now I can tell you what the units of the data are, actually they represent time taken to get service in a bank. This is actually from a bank and the customers are coming in and we are recording the amount of time taken to get the service that they came there for. Obviously scale data. So, and we are not going to reveal the bank we are not going to reveal the branch but this is essentially banking operations data and now you know this is time data. Do not look at the branch do not look at the bank look at what the variable represents? It represents time. Time can never be negative. So, this variable is always going to have a support over 0 to infinity. So, now I have told you the context and now you know that the context also seems to indicate that exponential distribution may not be that bad a fit. And you can take the support of queuing theory I am trying to introduce a new idea here queuing theory. Queuing theory tells you a lot about the time taken in a queue and therefore also you have some support to say that exponential distribution fits very well. Now that is a very vague statement that I made but read up on the queuing theory and you will understand why exponential distribution has a very strong association with queuing theory. Let me stop here and end the session here.
