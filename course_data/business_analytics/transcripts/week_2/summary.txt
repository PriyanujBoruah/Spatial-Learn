Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to digest the material from last week.

This week, we moved from the visual representation of data to the mathematical, diving into the crucial topic of probability distributions. We explored how to take a raw dataset and determine the underlying theoretical distribution that best describes itâ€”a fundamental skill for any form of business analytics or simulation.

Here's a recap of our journey this week.

Lecture 1: To Fit or Not to Fit?
We began by asking a fundamental question: when you have business data, what should you do with it? We outlined three primary approaches:

Trace-Driven Simulation: Use the raw data directly in your models. This is straightforward but has a major drawback: your model is only tested against the specific scenarios present in your collected data.

Fit a Theoretical Distribution: This is the preferred method. By fitting a known distribution (like Normal, Exponential, etc.), you can generate a much wider range of values for your simulations, allowing you to test your models under more varied conditions.

Build an Empirical Distribution: If no theoretical distribution fits well, you can build a custom distribution directly from your data. However, this approach shares some of the limitations of trace-driven simulation, as it's heavily constrained by the range of your observed data.

Lecture 2: The Art of the Educated Guess
Before we can formally test a distribution, we must first make an educated guess. I presented you with a dataset of 217 values, withholding the context to force a focus on the data's properties. We learned to look for clues in:

Summary Statistics: We observed that when the mean, median, and mode are different, the distribution is not symmetric, ruling out distributions like the Normal or Uniform.

Skewness: A positive skewness value (our data had a skewness of 1.46) indicates a "right-skewed" distribution, where the right tail is longer than the left. This pointed us toward distributions like the Exponential.

Coefficient of Variation (CV): We calculated the CV (Standard Deviation / Mean) and found it was close to 1. This is a strong indicator of an Exponential distribution, for which the CV is always 1.

Visuals: We used box plots and bar charts, which confirmed the right skew we saw in the statistics.

Finally, I revealed the context: the data represented the time taken for service at a bank. The context of "time" often aligns well with an Exponential distribution, reinforcing our data-driven guess.

Lecture 3: Checking the Fit
Guessing is not enough; we must verify. This lecture introduced the concept of Goodness-of-Fit tests. We focused on two powerful visual tools:

Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) Plots: These plots compare the quantiles of your sample data against the theoretical quantiles of your chosen distribution. If the fit is good, the points will align closely with a 45-degree line. Q-Q plots are particularly good at highlighting differences in the tails of the distributions.

P-P (Probability-Probability) Plots: These plots are similar but compare the cumulative probabilities instead of quantiles. They are better at highlighting differences in the middle portion of a distribution.

We saw that when we plotted our data against a Normal distribution, the points deviated significantly from the line. However, when plotted against an Exponential distribution, the fit was remarkably close, giving us strong visual confirmation of our guess.

Lectures 4, 5, & 6: Hands-On Tutorials
The rest of the week was dedicated to hands-on tutorials where we applied this systematic process to three different datasets, using Python to perform our analysis.

Tutorial 1: Poisson Distribution: Our first dataset was an example of discrete count data.

Clue: The mean (4.94) and variance (5.66) were very close, a classic hallmark of the Poisson distribution.

Confirmation: The P-P plot showed a poor fit against the default Normal distribution but an excellent fit when we specified a Poisson distribution.

Final Test: We performed a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, which yielded a very high p-value (0.63). This led us to not reject the null hypothesis, formally confirming that the data follows a Poisson distribution.

Tutorial 2: Normal Distribution: Our second dataset looked much more symmetric.

Clue: The histogram showed a central peak, and the mean (56.95) and median (56) were nearly identical. The skewness was also very low (0.37). These clues strongly suggested a Normal distribution.

Confirmation: The Q-Q and P-P plots showed an almost perfect fit against the normal line.

Final Test: The Chi-square test resulted in an extremely high p-value of 0.99, and the calculated test statistic (1.0) was much lower than the tabulated value (7.8), providing overwhelming evidence for the Normal distribution.

Tutorial 3: Uniform Distribution: The final dataset presented a different shape.

Clue: The histogram was relatively flat, and the descriptive statistics showed a very low standard deviation (2.65) and an even spread of data across the quantiles. This pointed towards a Uniform distribution.

Confirmation: The Q-Q and P-P plots, when compared against a uniform distribution, showed a near-perfect straight line.

Final Test: The Chi-square test gave a massive p-value (0.9999), confirming our guess with a high degree of confidence.

This concludes our week on distributions. The key takeaway is that identifying the correct distribution is a methodical process: start with visual and statistical clues to form a hypothesis, use probability plots for visual confirmation, and finally, employ a formal statistical test to prove your case.
