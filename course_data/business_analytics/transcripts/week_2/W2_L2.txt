So, let us come back. Let us you know from theory now. Let us take some examples. So, for taking this example what I have done is I have collected a dataset of 217 values. Right now I will not tell you the context. I will not tell you what the data is about. Sometimes the context of the data helps you guess a distribution. I am avoiding that because I am not even telling you what the data is about. I am not telling you the units of data for example I will not tell you whether it is dollars or minutes or something some other units I am not telling you that. I am just telling you that there are 217 values we have collected and for these data points we want to fit a theoretical probability distribution. Now let me tell you the properties of these 217 values. Let me tell you a summary statistics. So, you have all these things you know the mean of these 217 values is 0.40 median and mode values are different, apparently, there are multiple modes, standard deviation is 0.38 skewness is 1.46 and what else, minimum, maximum, minimum is 0.01 maximum is 1.96. So, what clues can you pick up from this summary statistics because this is going to help us build or guess a distribution. This is going to help us guess a distribution. Let us quickly understand what this summary statistics is telling us. If you noticed I have not named the variable. I have simply called it variable one. So, I have simply called it variable one just to tell you that there is no context to this variable. What do we notice first? This is what I notice first. Look at this. The mean is 0.4, the median is 0.28 the mode is 0.05 which means that mean is not same as mode is not same as median. So, what do I understand from this for a symmetric distribution the mean and the median and the modular value coincide at the same point. Remember normal distribution the most famous example of symmetric distribution. For a normal distribution this is where the mean is, this is where the mode is, this is where the median is. So, for a symmetric distribution the mean the median and the modular value are going to coincide. So, our data set seems to be not of this category. Our data set has a different mean, a significantly different median and significantly different modular value. So, our data is not from the symmetric distributions. So, that is ruled out. All the symmetric distributions we can rule out. Normal distribution is gone right now. Uniform distribution is gone right now. Okay, the mean value max value. The min value is 0.01, max value is 1.96. 217 values, none of these values seem to be on the negative side. So, the support of our distribution does not seem to be from negative infinity to positive infinity. Why am I saying that because if the variable could take on negative values from negative infinity to positive infinity out of these 217 values at least some of these values could have been negative. Not essential but very very unlikely that if the random variable can take negative values in the 217 values that I have observed none of them were negative. So, the minimum value was 0.01, the maximum value was 1.96 tells me that this is not the case ok. So, the the distributions that go to the negative side of the line probably are ruled out One more important clue. This. What does this tell me? What does this tell me ? Skewness. What does skewness tell me? Skewness is what? Skewness tells me about the symmetry of the distribution. Now for my data set and once again I have no clue what the data set represents. The data set seems to be skewed and particularly this is positive 1.46. What does that mean? It's a positive skew. Now do you recall what a positive skew means. Okay what a positive skew means? Positive skew means that it is skewed to the right. Skewed to the right means the right tail is bigger than the left tail. So, this is your random variable X. This is the density function. So, this is the left tail, this is the right tail. So, we are saying that a positive skew indicates that the right tail is bigger than the left tail. This, the difference in the mean mode and median told us that ours is anyway not a symmetric distribution. That was confirmed from the skewness value. Skewness value is now telling me that the right tail is bigger than the left tail. Right tail keeps on extending longer than the extension of the left tail. So, what are the positive skew distributions that I can think of. Imagine all of those in your mind and those are the potential candidates, those are the distributions that I may want to fit to my data. Right, so, these are the clues. We will discuss these clues in couple of slides. But these are the quick clues that I can understand from the summary statistics about the data set that I have collected. What more can I look at before I decide to fit a distribution? Can you think of anything else that I can present to you which will help you guess a distribution? Obviously graphical output, right? Why do not I show you box plot This is the box plot. You all know what a box plot is. If you have not discussed box plot, well, let us know and we will discuss box plot in the subsequent sessions. This box plot is a typical output from any statistical package but this box plot does not give me a true picture. So, let me tilt it by 90 degrees and show you this box plot. Same box plot actually tilt at 90 degrees. So, what does the box plot show? Box plot has this box. This is your box. What is this box? This box if you recall, this was the 25th percentile, this was the 75th percentile, the middle line is the 50th percentile. Do you know what is 50th percentile? Obviously the median and then the whiskers, going back. This whisker, the left whisker seems to be very short, the right whisker seems to be going all the way. Now what are these points 207 209 217 214? What are these points? These are the observation numbers. Recall we had a data set of 217 values. So, these are the observation numbers. So, observation number 214, observation number 213, observation number 210, observation number 209. So, the right tail seems to be, the right side values seem to be going. These are the values. So, the median is somewhere here. This is somewhere the median and what was the median? Let me go back to the previous slide. Let us go back one more, let us go back one more. What was the median? Median was 0.28. Let us see where the median is. 0.28, yeah, somewhere there is 0.28. So, the left whisker seems to be only up to that point the right whisker seems to be up to this point. However there are values beyond the right whiskers. So, recall all the discussions that you may have had about the box plot and an interpretation of the box plot. The only point that I wish to emphasize from the box plot, the shape of the box plot is that the values on the right hand side are extending well into the right side of the x axis which essentially means that this distribution has a right skew. This distribution has a positive skew. What else? Let me show you the bar chart for this data. This is the bar chart. Looks similar to box plot. Now it tells us that there are large number of values which are close to zero, very large number of values, about 15% of the values are very very close to 0, very close to 0 and then the kind of frequency drops and there are very few values which are more than 1.5. Very very few values, few observations which are more than 1.5. Recall our range was anyway 1.95 where the maximum value was 1.96. So, this must have been 1.96. So, this is the frequency, the height of the bar chart obviously represents the frequency. Now you may change the width of the bar chart and try to get different shapes. This is slightly thicker bars. The earlier one was slightly thinner bars but the frequency seems to be dropping as you go in the values. So, as the values increases the frequency seems to be dropping. Has this given you some clues about what may be a distribution to fit, what distribution may fit the data? Any clues? Any ideas? keep thinking, keep thinking. I will show you one more bar chart even thicker bar this time. So, once again as the values of the random variable increases the frequency seems to be decreasing. So, let us formally write down what clues we get. what are the clues that we are trying to understand from the data. So, usually, for summarising whatever we have discussed so far, for symmetric distributions the mean and the median and the mode matches. If in the data set if the mean value and the median value are sufficiently close to each other we may still think about symmetric distributions but then you will ask me how close is close enough? What is sufficiently close? Well, those right now we are only making a educated guess. We have not made any decision yet. We are only guessing distributions. So, if mean and median seem to be close enough you can try out symmetric distributions to fit the data but if the mean and median are not close enough probably symmetric distributions is not the way to go forward. Look at the coefficient of variation this is something that we had missed out looking at the summary statistics. What is coefficient of variation? Do you recall what was coefficient of variation? Coefficient of variation, CV, is indicated by mu by sigma sorry sigma by mu. Now what is the sigma here? Sigma is 0.38 and the mean is 0.4. This is your estimation of sigma. I mean this is not exactly sigma, this is actually s which is sample standard deviation and you have a sample size of 217. In absence of anything else, you are going to say that this is my population standard deviation. And this is my sample mean and I am going to say that this is my best estimate for population mean. So, the CV seems to be close to 1. 0.38 divided by 0.4. Now CV does give me some indication. If the CV is close to one exponential distribution. CV for exponential distribution is always one. If you recall one by lambda and one by lambda are the mean and variance. Sorry, 1 by lambda and 1 by lambda is the mean and standard deviation. So, for exponential distribution, CV is always 1. For our data CV seems to be close to one. If the histogram looks slightly right skewed distribution with CV greater than 1, log normal distribution may be a better approximation for our data. Why is that true? Look at the shape of the normal distribution log normal distribution. So, for some distributions, however, this CV data is not even useful. Not useful. Because it is not even defined. When is that? What are the examples when CV may not even be defined? Recall what was CV? CV was sigma by mu. Now do you recall standard normal distribution? Standard normal distribution mu is zero. If mu is zero, CV may not even be defined. So, how are you going to use CV? So, note that using CV may give us clues. However this is not the tell all kind of a thing it gives us clues sometimes it may not even be available. There is something called a lexis ratio. Lexis ratio is essentially CV for discrete distributions. Similar interpretations but that is not called CV that is usually called lexis ratio. Now we have already discussed this skewness. Skewness may give us some hints. Skewness for normal distribution is zero. Because skewness represents asymmetry of the data and normal distribution is famously symmetric. So, if the skewness value is 0 you are thinking about all the symmetric distributions like normal distribution. If skewness is positive, you are thinking about right skewed distribution for example exponential distribution which has a skewness of two. And for skewness values which are less than zero, negative skew, you are talking about left skew distribution where the left tail is bigger than the right tail. The left tail extends longer than the right tail. Now let me pause here and ask you. Looking at all these discussions what seems to be a good fit for our data? Our data has mean mode median different, skewness is positive, CV seems to be close to one. CV seems to be close to one and we saw box plot, we saw bar chart, we saw a lot of things, what do you think? I would say let us try fitting exponential distribution to our data. One thing you also notice what is the support for exponential data. Support meaning what are the values that an exponential random variable can take. Exponential random variable can take values from zero to infinity. Can take values from zero to infinity, remember in our data set we didn't have any negative values. So, the support could start from 0. Obviously our maximum value was 1.95, 1.96. Exponential distribution can go all the way to infinity. But why do not we check whether exponential distribution fits very well. So, we are going to try that at the end of the session, we are going to share an excel sheet where you can try out whether exponential distribution fits very well but I have some results towards that. So, let us go further, let's go beyond. Once you have done that, once you have estimated a distribution to be fit, let us estimate the parameters. So, parameters, every probability distribution has a parameter or set of parameters for example binomial distribution you need n which is the number of experiments to be conducted and p which is the probability of success in each trial. For normal distribution mu and sigma are the two parameters. For exponential distribution lambda is the parameter. You know what lambda is. This is your lambda and you know how lambda plays a very very important role in defining the density function and therefore define defining all the subsequent properties of the exponential distribution. Now the most commonly used method to estimate the parameters of our distribution happens to be MLE. What is MLE? it is the most likelihood method, most likelihood estimation. And I am assuming that MLE was also discussed in some course in some sessions for you before ,therefore, we are not going to focus on how do you estimate parameters using most likelihood estimators. You define a log estimate, a log likelihood function, you take the derivative of that log likelihood function and then that's how you estimate the parameters of your distribution. Let's not go deeper into MLE but let us say that I have guessed a distribution. For my data set, I have guessed a distribution. Right now I am going to try out exponential distribution. Now exponential distribution has a single parameter called lambda and using maximum likelihood estimation method, I probably have guessed the value of lambda. Let us say that, that is also done. What's next? Obviously guessing a distribution is clearly not enough. We have to check how good exponential distribution fits the data. How good is this fit? We have, we right now have kind of thought that exponential data will, exponential distribution will fit the data. Well, how good is this fit? That's the next thing to be done.
