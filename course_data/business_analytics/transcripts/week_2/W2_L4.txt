Hello everyone and welcome to this first tutorial for the business analytics course which is going to be on distributions. So, today Dr Malolan is joining with us and he is going to take us through the task of identifying distributions and fitting distributions. Hello Malolan, Hey Swami. We have three interesting datasets. So, our task is to guess the distribution first and check whether the guess is right. Correct. So, um usually in business problems the first order of business is to find out a distribution and this tutorial video is going to be about that and like Swami said we are going to look at three different datas and try to find the distribution for it. And usually the approach that we take is that we first look at uh let us say descriptive visualizations. Then use descriptive statistics to you know further identify distributions and then finally we go in for actual tests to confirm our judgment. So, that is what we usually do and we will demonstrate that using python today. Yes as uh discussed in the course outline. The emphasis of this course will be not on coding in fact we give you the codes and the dataset you can run and practice these fitting distributions yourself. So, therefore the emphasis will be more on the interpretation part and not on the coding part. So, with that so let's get started. So, first of all let me show you the dataset first. So, in the lecture video you would have seen, professor Rahul, he would not have mentioned the business case first. So, he would have shown you the data first and after guessing the distribution and fitting the distribution later he would expose you to the business case. So, we will follow the same approach now I am not going to give you the business context. First we will look at the dataset we guess the distribution we will do some statistical tests and then look at the business case. So, first I am showing you the excel file then we will load this excel file to python and do the required steps for finding the distribution. So, this is the dataset it is a beautiful dataset because it has only one column and the column name is observations or OBS and if you look at the count. So, we have around 101 out of which one is the header. So, there are 100 data points available with us. So, without any further delay let us load this dataset into into python and then start with the descriptive statistics. So, you must you might be already aware of the python software you could do it in multiple IDEs. So, we are using Google collaborator you could also do the same with Jupiter notebooks, Spider or Pycharm whichever is of interest to you. So, let me upload the dataset which is data one which is also an excel file. So, we have uploaded the dataset and then I am going to import certain libraries which you are already aware of python, pandas and numpy and then I am reading the excel file. So, now let us look at this data frame. So, if you look at the data frame. So, there is one column, hundred rows and we cannot say much from this. So, therefore let us get into some visualization like histogram. Yeah just to add uh to those who are comparatively newer at python whenever you upload a dataset if you can just scroll up with swami. Sure . Yeah. So, if you see the header is obs (observations) and the values 5, 4, 4, 5, 5 those are the observations and the column next to that is actually the index. So, index 0 refers to the first observation which is 5 index 1 refers to the second observation which is 4. So, 0 1 2 3 4 is the index and then you have the actual data that you are going to use just for the clarity of those who are new to python. Alright, from the histogram. So, I have just plotted a histogram using matplotlib. So, these are things which you are already aware of. So, first I have plotted the histogram. So, Malo, so, does this histogram tell us a story actually histograms are very very interesting graphs and all of you whenever you get any data and you want to find the distribution the first order of business is to plot a histogram and the beautiful question there for me whenever you look at a histogram, you can look at it and tell what family of distributions a dataset may belong to. So, looking at this one thing that we can say that it could be a non-Gaussian distribution since there are two peaks instead of just one. That is the first observation but you cannot say whether it is a symmetric or non-symmetric distribution. So, for that we need to do further further graphs, very true. So, very well said. So, with that let us do some descriptive statistics. So, df dot describe is going to give us the basic statistics like count mean standard deviation and so on uh. So, we have a mean of 4.94 and standard deviation of 2.38. So, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 11 and then we have median at 5. So, we may not conclude certain things from these basic statistics. So, let us do some more descriptive statistics like kurtosis and skewness. So, the next line of code is going to give us kurtosis skewness variance and mean. Malo, if you observe this the variance and mean are kind of close to each other not exactly close but they are somehow pretty close to each other. Exactly. So, we from the histogram we actually said it is a non-Gaussian distribution but we did not know which it could be. So, at this point maybe our viewers can actually pause and think about what distribution would have a mean and variance almost close to each other and yeah that. So, that is the best clue for replacing this particular distribution mean and variance yeah. So, the answer to that would be a Poisson distribution. So, we can say with some amount of certainty using the histogram and the descriptive statistics that you have actually plotted to conclude that this data that is given to us can be a Poisson, yes exactly and also we have some kurtosis which is negative 0.38 and skewness of 0.51. Exactly. It also tells us that we can eliminate certain symmetric distributions, exactly such as normal, uniform. Normal gets eliminated when we say non-gaussian no?. Yes. In the histogram we will usually generate normal but we still have distribution such as uniform which would have peaks but it is also a symmetric distribution. So, that can be eliminated using the kurtosis and skewness, yes. So, very well said with that let us also look at the median which may not give us a lot of insight. But it is interesting it is a symmetric distribution. So, the median is five the mean is also five which means 50% is lying below and 50% of the points are lying above. So, it is still a symmetric distribution but Poisson is not a symmetric distribution. So because still do not have enough evidence to conclude that this is python ah this is Poisson. Exactly Exactly. So, the best way to do that is by means of statistical testing which is Chi square goodness of fit for which we need to have data in certain format. So, let us build our data frame let us make it in a way that is understable for that is understandable for the python language. So, I am importing certain libraries like statsmodels.api and scipy.stats and then. So, before getting into the statistical testing so can we have a look at certain interesting plots like Q-Q plot and P-P plot which was already covered in the lecture by Professor Rahul. So, we have a P-P plot. So, what does this say. This says all right. So in python the first thing that we have to understand is in python whenever we run a code for any of the plots it is always comparing it with the standard normal and it is going to give you a conclusion. We will not go into depths of what P-P plot is what Q-Q plot is but just an overview. So, in a P-P plot we are going to compare the standard normal for without any code we are going to compare the standard normal with the actual distribution their sample that we have got. And we are going to compare the cumulative distributions of both and if both come from the same population then they rely on a straight line. So, this particular plot that has been plotted it is showing you that they are not lying on a straight line they are not lying on the trend line they are actually parallel to each other which means the data is not coming from a normal. Alright?. So, that is what can be concluded from this particular P-P plot also the other interesting thing is that uh since this deals with CDF which is the cumulative distribution function. So, we have data similar to a step function which also gives us that this distribution could be discrete in nature. Exactly exactly fantastic yeah. So, therefore the next step is to fit this P-P plot with the Poisson distribution. So, right now as you said by default it is comparing the given data with uh standard normal distribution. So, now why don't we try it with Poisson and check how the P-P plot is exactly. So, since we have we are choosing Poisson because our mean and our standard mean and our variance are almost close to each other but it is still not conclusive because the median is also same as the mean. So, we want to confirm with a more stronger descriptive or a visualization say and for that we are going to develop the P-P plot and for this P-P plot we are going to say the distribution is Poisson. So, what can it happen poison with a mean of 4.94. So, that is the code that is equal to run. Exactly. So, I use this syntax called stats dot probability plot or stats dot proplot which is nothing but the P-P plot and I am having the observations here. So, we have around 100 observations. So, this means that you have a data frame and the column that we are using is observation and the distribution is Poisson and the parameter here is 4.94. So, this parameter we got from the descriptive statistics if you can look at the mean observed. It is also 4.94. So, therefore I have this line which is stats dot probability plot df of observation and distribution is Poisson and the parameter is 4.94 which is nothing but the mean of the Poisson distribution or lambda. And if I plot this oh it looks beautiful. Yes now the points are almost around that same line. So, which means that we can with a certain degree of certainty say that the cumulative distribution from which this observation or this data is coming is a Poisson which has a mean which has a lambda of 4.94. So, that is what the P-P plot is actually helping us conclude. So, with this lets get into the data frame again. I think we might have even forgotten the data frame because we were into too much of visualization. So, that is our data frame. So, now let us group this data frame and see what are the frequencies and the respective bins. So, we are now going into a more statistical approach of establishing that it is a Poisson. So, through a visualization we have established that it is a Poisson. Now through a statistical technique the chi squared technique we are going to establish that it is a Poisson and for that we will follow these steps. So, the first step is I am creating an empty data frame called group df and in group df I am creating a column called frequency. So, in that frequency I am actually grouping by using observations and count. So, if you look at this data frame the 1 is nothing but the observation 1. So, that is coming 3 times in the dataset if you look at 2 it is appearing 14 times in the dataset and likewise we have 11 classes or 11 bins and if you see look at the tail end 10 and 2 they are coming only two times in the dataset. If you look at nine it comes five times in the dataset and so on. Can you comment on these things yeah. So, maybe as a you know just as an explanation that the code is working fine uh why don't you just open the excel and put a filter and choose observation one. For example yeah you can just add a filter yeah and now if you just filter the observation 1 it is appearing three times in the data frame. So, that is what this has been done. So, 1 is appearing three times. So, if you put 2 it will appear fourteen times 3 it is appearing fifteen times. So, why is this required you will get to know in the immediate next pieces of code. So, it is appearing 15 times 14 times yeah 14 times yeah one header here. So, next in addition to this frequency column I am creating another column called observed probability. So, what does observe probability do we can print and check it out. We are actually calculating the probability of 1 occurring in the dataset. So, for that we divide this frequency by the length of data frame which is hundred. So, if you want we can check all check on those parameters. For example if I just give length of the data frame it is going to show 100 and frequency you already know that was the previous step. So, we are dividing the previous step by the length of data frame which is hundred. So, now we have two beautiful columns one is frequency and observed probability and then we come to the most important step where we are calculating the theoretical probability. So, right now now we calculated the observed uh probability from the dataset. So, right now we are going to calculate the theoretical probability for that I am importing certain packages which you already know scipy from scipy - I am importing stats package and then I am also importing Poisson and chi square. So, if you look at this command Poisson dot pmf. So, this is nothing but the command. So, this function requires two important arguments one is k, other one is the argument which could be the mean. So, let me complete this command. So, I am creating another command called I am creating another column called Poisson pmf where I am using this function called poisson.pmf and we have something called k and inside k. So, let me run this and then show you what this k is, let me add a column above. So, let us see what this k means. Inside k we have grouped underscore df under df dot index. So, you have these 11 classes. Right?. Which are available here the observed the index of this data frame, which means that we have the classes or the buckets as one of the parameters which has been available in inside group, group underscore df dot index and next is nothing but the argument mu, mu is nothing but the Poisson distribution parameter lambda. In our case we have the mean from the dataset. So, let us also check what that means. So, let us print this and check what the what this command is going to give us it should ideally return 4.94. So, therefore I am using this function called Poisson.pmf where I have given two arguments one is k which has the group underscore df dot index which indicates the number of classes and then the next argument is mu which is going which is nothing but the mean of the observed uh values of the sample, of the sample. So, I think I have I am just repeating those steps here which are of not interest to us. So, now let us print group underscore df. So, right now we have three columns one is frequency observed probability and observed pmf. Let us also create another column called Poisson frequency. One second again swami, may be for those who are seeing this data frame now uh the Poisson pmf is basically going to tell you. Okay, let us say the observed probability is telling you the in the sum from the sample what is the probability of that observation happening. So, that is 0.03 whereas the Poisson pmf is telling you from the population, from assuming that the population is a Poisson with a mean of 4.94 what is the probability of getting one. So, that is the difference between the two columns that are present in this particular data frame. So, observed probability is in the sample what was the probability of one happening and Poisson pmf is basically telling you from the population from which this sample comes, if that is a Poisson with 4.94 then what is the probability of observing a 1 in that population. So, that is the difference between the two. Very well said. So, let us create this new column called Poisson frequency and then print the data frame. So, now we have four columns. So, one is obsorbed frequency, observed probability, Poisson probability and Poisson frequency. So, do they look close enough. Yes they right? You have uh the first one is close enough the second one is not. So, much third is close fourth is close. So, visually it is somewhat matching maybe 80% is matching but is that match significant is what we have to answer. Yes and so also the Poisson frequency. I mean since Poisson is a discrete distribution and so we have this frequency in decimals. Your number of decimals are too much. So, let us round it off to two. So, that it looks better. So, ideally it is the theoretical frequency therefore you can have decimals and now I am creating two lists one is observed frequency other is expected frequency and. So, this observed frequency is nothing but the the first column which is this 3, 14, 15 and so on and second one is nothing but the Poisson frequency which is 3.53, 8.73 and so on. So, let us also print that and see. So, let us print. So, that is our observed frequency. So, similarly if you print the expected frequency. So, we have 11 in both. So, now let us talk about the null hypothesis. So, the null hypothesis according to Chi square test, chi square goodness of fit test says that the data follows Poisson distribution and the alternate hypothesis says that the given data does not follow Poisson distribution. So, for this we already have imported certain packages like chi square Poisson and so on. So, now we are going to do the test, stats dot chi square between the observed frequency and the expected frequency. So, let us see how the test is performing. So, we have a statistic which is nothing but the chi square statistic that says 7.91 and we have a p value of 0.63. So, Malo, so how do we go about this. Can we talk about confidence level that we are looking at yeah. So, whenever you are interpreting a p value it is basically going to tell you the probability of observing this particular sample when the null hypothesis is assumed to be true and when you are doing that in this particular case you are getting a probability of 63% almost. So, which basically means this is this is said to be almost coming from the distribution. So, you can accept the null and the second way of looking at it is you give something called as the alpha value and if the p value is greater than the alpha which is the significance level then you can say okay I uh the null hypothesis is acceptable and the p value let us say I talk about a probability I initially said the probability. So, probability is a number. So, you must compare that number whether it is bigger or smaller to something else. So, that is the alpha value that you will compare it to. So, for whatever alpha I take whether it is 5% or 10% or 15% this p value is going to be greater than that it is going to be greater than 0.05 0.15 or let us say 0.10. So, we will say that the null hypothesis is not rejected. You do not reject the null and you will say this sample is coming from a Poisson there is another way to uh confirm this. So, we did this using p value the other way is to look at the calculated chi-square value with the tabulated chi square value . So, for that I am importing another uh library I think which we have already imported this. So, let us run this. So, scipy dot stats dot chi square dot tpf, it is going to give us the tabulated chi square value for a confidence level of 95%. So, therefore I have used 1 minus 0.05 you can also give 0.95 directly here the degrees of freedom is mentioned as 9 for chi square it is k - p - 1. So, the parameter for chi square is just the mean or lambda. So, therefore the p value is 1 here. So, we have 11 classes that is k. So, 11 minus 1 is 10 minus 1 is 9. So, therefore we have a degrees of freedom of 9. So, Malo you want to add something more to this yeah. So, in general when you are doing a chi square test like swami said we are going to do k - p - 1 where k is the number of buckets that we have. So, we have 11 buckets in this particular case p is the number of parameters we estimate from the sample since we are only uh theorizing about the observation or upload the about the distribution our p value here is computed as the mean. So, p is 1 only the mean is being computed. Number one. So, k minus 1 minus 1 which is the formula k - 1 1, which is the formula, so 11 - 1 - 1 which is 9 degrees of freedom. And as Swami rightly pointed out he putting it as one 1 0.05. Where he is taking this alpha as 5% so you can also directly give it as 95% for 0.95. Yes. Yeah and this number that you are getting for the interest of readers should it be greater than this is a question should it be greater than the computed test statistic for you to accept the null hypothesis or should be should it be lesser than the computed test statistic for you to accept the null hypothesis. So, that is a question for you guys. Just pause think about it then we will again show you what is the computed value. Over to you swami yes I hope you guys would have guessed it. So, now without any further delay so let me run this and show you the. Okay I think I have to import this. So, we have a calculated chi square value of 16.91. So, we can compare this with the calculated value which is 7.9. So, the answer should is actually if our tabulated value is greater than our computed value then do not reject the null hypothesis. So, in this case our tabulated value is greater than our computed value. So, we do not reject the null hypothesis and hence we can conclude that the Poisson distribution is the population from which our particular sample is coming from. Exactly. So, our guess was right, we guessed it as a Poisson and it is a Poisson distribution. And Malo, so can you talk about some business cases for Poisson distribution. Yeah. So, um let us say let us go back to our data itself let us go back to our data shall we open the excel? Yeah you can open the excel, let me clear the filter yes. So, this particular dataset is just giving you numbers 5, 4, 4, 5 and the most common place where Poisson distributions usually occur are places where you have events happening. For example let us say this was at a traffic signal in some Chennai location where the number of times the signal was violated. So, in a particular day, so, in a particular day let us say that was day 1 row number two is actually 1. The signal was violated 5 times in row number three the signal was related four times on day number 2. So, on each day how many times anyone had violated that signal. So, that is a count information. So, this could be an example for such a scenario you could also look at it from a different sense. Let us say you are manufacturing products every day you are manufacturing thousand products out of those thousand products how many are defective. So, five could be defective on particular day's production four, could be a defect on the number of uh four per units or were of defect on another day of production so on and so forth. So, wherever you have count information those places could be could be ideal for poison distributions to happen. Great. So, to put it in the natural number of discrete events happening over a continuous space is Poisson distribution the other examples could include customer arrivals and so on. So, with this we will conclude the Poisson distribution.
