Welcome to the new session, we are continuing our discussion on the Multiple Linear Regression Model. If you recall in the last session, we had looked at this smallish example, where we were trying to understand the variation in the CGPA in the MBA program being explained using two variables, the scores on the entrance examination and the scores in the interview. So, X1 and X2 were our explanatory variables, Y which is a CGPA in the MBA program was the response variable. The coefficient of correlation the correlation matrix, we highlighted these three, We highlighted these values, saying that entrance examination and CGPA in the MBA program are highly positively correlated. Similarly, the interview scores and the CGPA in the MBA program are also highly correlated. I am using the term CGPA and GPA interchangeably. Let us, not focus on that is. The idea is to understand the relationship model. Because of these high coefficients of correlation, we included these two variables in our multiple regression model and this was our regression output. We looked at the interpretation 0.86 was the correlation coefficient between observed Y and predicted Y, this 628 0.62628 is our estimate of sigma epsilon R squared 0.74 tells us the capability of explaining the variation because of the regression model. So, we are going to say that 74 percent of the variation in Y can be is explained using the regression model that we have built. The regression model was significant, the P-value was a quite small individual P values of the beta was also quite small individual beta values of the individual P values of the beta were also quite small rejecting even that null hypothesis. So, these were our estimates of the partial slope b1 estimating beta 1 b2 estimating beta 2. Now, let us draw the path diagram, why are we trying to draw the path diagram let me take you back to the correlation matrix. Focus on this guy here, 0.54 represents the correlation between the two explanatory variable entrance examination scores, and the interview scores are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.54, which is not trivial, 0.54 is quite significant, it is not as strong as the correlation that they have with the response variable, but it is still good enough. Ideally, we wanted our explanatory variables to be independent of each other, which means that this correlation coefficient should have been close to 0, this correlation coefficient should have been close to 0, it is not. So, let us see if there is an impact of this correlation on the interpretation of the relationship between an explanatory variable and the response variable. Let me take you back to the PPT, where we had looked at the path diagram, path diagram as we said, if you recall, we said explanatory variable X1 has an impact on Y, explanatory variable X2 has an impact on Y. However, if X1 and X2 are correlated X1 may have an impact on X2. So, the total effect of X1 can be split into two parts, one is the direct impact of X1 on Y, one is this indirect path X1 influencing X2 and X2 influencing Y and therefore, this path, this path here, this part here, this path here is called the indirect effect of X1 on Y, this part is called the direct effect of X1 on Y. Let us see if we can quantify this direct effect and indirect effect for our example. So, let me create a blank sheet so that I can scribble on it. What are our excellent three variables? The entrance examination score and the interview score and the response variable are the GPA in college. Now, when we consider both the explanatory variables in the model, their impact is the partial slope. So, what were our partial slopes for the entrance examination if you recall, let me take you there. Let me take you there what were the partial slopes, partial slopes 0.455 for entrance examination 0. 622 for interview. So, 0.455 and 0.622. Now, we saw that entrance examination interviews are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 1.54. So, now, let us try to study the indirect effect of entrance examination on CGPA on GPA in college indirect effect. What was the indirect effect? How did we define indirect effect? We said entrance examination may influence interview, the interview is anyway influencing GPA in college. So, this route is the indirect effect of entrance examination on GPA in college. Now, for that to be quantified we already know this part 0.622. What is this here? What was 622? 622 was the correlation 622 was the regression coefficient, not the correlation coefficient, 0.622 was the regression coefficient. So, this was my beta 2 this was my beta 1 estimate of beta 1 was 0.455 estimate of beta 2 was 0.622. So, I need to have I need to gather the regression coefficient. Now, this time for this question mark, what do I want? I want the regression coefficient where the interview is the response variable and entrance examination is the explanatory variable look at the arrowhead, this arrowhead represented entrance examination as the explanatory variable GPA in the college as the response variable, here interview was the explanatory variable, GPA in college was the response variable. Similarly, the arrow is drawn in this direction. So, I will use the entrance examination as the explanatory variable. So, my explanatory variable is the entrance examination score and my response variable is the interview score. Let us, actually run this regression. Let us get out of PPT, let us go to my Excel now let us go to data copy-paste the data, what do I want? I do not want Y here, I only want these two, the sheet is empty let me paste it here. Now, what do I want? I want the entrance examination to be an explanatory variable interview to be response variables. So, let us run this regression go to data, go to analysis, go to regression, I do not want this I do not want this. Let us plug in new values here, what is my response variable? My response is the interview. So, let us do that, my response is the interview score, my explanatory variable X X variable is the entrance examination score and where do I want the output. So, this is the output of the simple linear regression between entrance examination and interview scores. Why are we running this regression? Because we found that even the explanatory variables are correlated. We ideally want the explanatory variables to be independent of each other. So, this 0.54 is not a surprising number, this 0.54 is the same 0.54 coefficient of correlation. So, this 0.54 is the correlation coefficient, R squared of 0.29, 29 percent ability to explain the variability. This regression has 0.03 as the P-value, what is this P-value for? This P-value for this P-value is the overall significance of the regression this value is smaller than 0.05, therefore, I will reject the null hypothesis that the regression is not significant and conclude that the regression is significant. Now, all the other numbers can be interpreted let me focus on this number here, let me focus on this number here, what is this number here? This is the regression coefficient when we run the regression where an interview is the response and entrance examination is the explanatory variable. So, how will you write this expression? How will you write this regression equation? We will say that Y is equal to beta naught plus beta 1X. What is beta naught? It is 4.82 plus 0.42 into X. What is Y here? Y here is interview 4.82 plus 0.42 into entrance examination. So, this is a simple linear regression where the interview was used as a response variable entrance examination was used as the explanatory variable and focus on the regression coefficient 0.42. Now, let us go back to our PPT. Let us, actually write these expressions down. So, for what do we have? We have GPA in college is equal to some beta naught let us not worry about that plus 0.455 into entrance examination plus 0.455, 0.622 into the interview, I am going to skip the error item. What is the other explanation that we have? We just now found out that interview is equal to some beta naught let us not focus on that because right now, we are focusing only on the regression coefficients, the regression coefficient was 0.42 into entrance examination. So, this question mark now has a number that number turns out to be 0.42. So, what is the indirect effect of entrance examinations on GPA? Entrance Examination influencing interview how much 1 unit change in the entrance examination changes the interview scores by 0.42 unit that is what it means, 1 unit change in the entrance examination changes the interview scores by 0.42 units in turn 1 unit change in the interview score changes the GPA in college by 0.622 units. So, what is the indirect effect? The indirect effect of entrance examination on GPA, what is the indirect effect? It is this 0.42 multiplied by 0.622, can you tell me what this number is? Do you want me to calculate? Let us calculate no problems, 0.42 multiplied by 0.622 it is 0.26. So, let us write that down 0.26, this is the indirect effect of entrance examination score on the GPA score in college indirect effect. What is the direct effect? The direct effect we said is 0.455. So, what is the direct effect? The direct effect of entrance examination on GPA is 0.455. So, what is the total effect? The total effect of entrance examination on GPA. What is that? Add this up 0.26 plus 0.455. What is that number? Can we add that up? Once again let us go to the calculator we should have a calculator, why close it down 0.2, 0.26 plus 0.455, which is 0.715. Where did we find this 0.715? Do we know where we found this 0.715 or close to 0.715 value? Do you recall that? That is the total effect of the entrance examination score on the CGPA scores. If you go to the simple linear regression where entrance examination was the explanatory variable and CGPA was the response variable look at the coefficient of regression 0.72 and what we have now is 0.715 fairly close. So, this is your total effect and where does this come from this comes from the simple linear regression of EE and GPA that is the total effect. So, this is how you write the path diagram you want to take this one more time, let us do this one more time. Let us draw this 1 more time this time the again same thing, what are the two explanatory variables entrance examination score, interview score influencing GPA in college this was 0.455 this was 0.622. Now, let us look at the other way. Now, let us say entrance examination scores influence the entrance examination interview scores influencing the entrance examination score, which was different than the earlier case we said entrance examination influencing the interview. This time let us say interview scores influence the entrance examination score. For that what do we need this explanation remains the same this is the same. So, let us write that down. So, GPA in college GPA in college is equal to sum beta naught plus 0.455 into entrance examination score plus 0.622 into interview scores, which remains the same. Now, to get this regression coefficient, what do I need to do? I need to have what variable is the explanatory variable and what variable is a response variable. Here I had used the interview as a response variable because the arrowhead was pointing to the interview and entrance examination score as the explanatory variable here it is exactly opposite. Now, the arrow is pointing to EE. So, what should be my response variable? Here the response variable was an interview. Here the response variable will be the entrance examination score. Here the explanatory variable was entrance examination and the explanatory variable will be interview scores. Let us run this regression. It is going to be a simple linear regression. Once again where is my data? I only need these two columns, add a sheet here is the sheet. Now, I run a regression data once again recap my interview is the explanatory variable entrance examination score is the response variable remember that Y is EE data analysis regression remove all this. This time I want to use, what? Your Y is EE. So, the entrance examination score is your Y and the explanatory variable is your interview, there are labels and run the regression. 0.54 is not surprising it is the same as 0.54 because I am using the same two variables interview and entrance examination 0.29 standard error has changed. The overall regression is significant, this is my P-value for the overall hypothesis that the regression is not significant P value less than 0.5 0.05 tells me that the null hypothesis has to be rejected. All the other interpretations can be made you know how to interpret a simple linear regression excel output the thing to focus on is this 0.68. What is this 0.68? This 0.68 is the regression co- efficient this is the regression coefficient. So, what are we saying? We are saying that the entrance examination is equal to some beta naught. By the way is this significant? Yes, 0.03. So, the P-value is good some beta naught plus this value is 0.68 into interview scores. This was different than what we had here. Here we had entrance examination as the explanatory variable interview as the response variable. This time we have opposite entrance examination as the response variable interview as an explanatory variable. So, let us take this 0.68 from this and go to my PPT. So, what is the other expression that we have now? We have an entrance examination that is equal to some beta naught plus 0.68 into the interview. So, an interview directly influences CGPA, what is the direct influence? 0.622. Now, it indirectly influences CGPA through entrance examination scores, we are saying that the interview scores influence entrance examination, entrance examination scores anyway in turn influence GPA in college. So, what is this now, this is 0.68? So, once again using the same logic let us quantify the direct effect indirect effect, and the total effect. So, what is the indirect effect of interview scores on GPA score it is this route, the indirect effect is always this route, which is 0.68 multiplied by 0.455. Can you tell me what this number is? This number turns out to be 0.31. What is the direct effect? The direct effect of the interview on GPA scores can be directly read which is 0.622, can you add this up? If you add this up you are going to get 0.93. Where had we seen 0.93? This is the total effect addition of indirect effect and direct effect is the total effect of interview scores on the CGPA scores this is 0.93 and where did we get the where have we seen 0.93? Let us go to Excel. In particular, you know where I am going to go I am going to go to simple linear regression where the interview was used as an explanatory variable for my CGPA. So, when I had used interviews as the only explanatory variable are trying to explain variation in the CGPA in college at that time the regression coefficient was 0.934 which is similar to this 0.93. So, this is the total effect. Why did this happen? Why did we get this 0.31? We got this 0.31 because the explanatory variables entrance examination score and interview scores were not independent, this 0.68 was the regression coefficient between the two explanatory variables very similarly, this 0.42 was the regression coefficient between the explanatory variables should not be dependent should not have such a high correlation coefficient 0.54 was the correlation. So, this indirect effect came into significance only because of the correlation between the entrance examination and the interviews scores which were my explanatory variables. Otherwise, the marginal slope would have been the same as the partial slope. If the indirect effect would have been 0, the marginal slope would have been the same as the partial slope. This was the marginal slope and this is the partial slope this 0.455 came from the multiple linear regression. So, this is always the partial slope. Similarly, here this 0.93 is the marginal slope and this 0. 622 is the partial slope, this would have been the same as the marginal slope would have been the same as the partial slope. If the indirect route was insignificant. However, here the indirect route of influence is not insignificant it is quite significant contributing 0.31, and therefore, the total effect is 0.93, whereas the partial effect was only 0.622. I hope this is understandable, the idea was not to explain multiple linear regression because you already know the idea was to present an interesting scenario where the explanatory variables may have a nontrivial correlation. So, let us end the session here and continue with this in the next session. We will look at what is called as VIF Variance Inflation Factor. We will look at that in the next session. We will end the session here.
