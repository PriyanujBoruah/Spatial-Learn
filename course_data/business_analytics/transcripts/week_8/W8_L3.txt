Welcome back to the third session on efficiency quantification. Now, we are going to discuss the analytical method. As promised, the analytical method, which is actually an optimization method to quantify and compare efficiencies of economic units, various economic units. So, even the graphical method was part of what is called data envelopment analysis, but in this session, we will highlight important features of this data envelopment analysis. So, let us jump into it. So, what is DEA? DEA is actually a very old idea. Originally, the idea came in the late 50s, about 57-58. And then, two really important models came out in the 70s and 80s (bonds) Karmas' and Cooper and which was called the BCC, and then it was called Karmas', Cooper and Rhodes. Those are the two popular models of data envelopment analysis. If you want to look up their research articles and they have published extensively and explained various aspects of this data envelopment analysis. So, what is this data envelopment analysis which is going to be a very helpful tool in the quantification of efficiency? It is a non-parametric mathematical method, non-parametric against parametric methods, and you know by now what is the difference between a parametric method and a non-parametric method. Essentially, the objective is still the same as what we had in the graphical method; it is to find the production frontier. It is a mathematical method; it is an optimization problem. It is essentially used to calculate the productive efficiency of an economic unit. We have to further classify this and say that we are going to only calculate the relative productive efficiency. Relative because the efficiency is going to depend only on the set of economic units that we have considered in this example. If you change the sample of the economic unit that you are going to consider, the efficiency values are going to change. In that sense, it is relative productive efficiency. So, the economic unit is going to be now called DMU. So, far we have been referring to this as an economic unit, an economic unit, organization. So, this agent, which is involved in economic activity, is going to be now referred to as DMU; Decision Making Unit. As I said earlier, the decision-making unit could be a single individual, could be a doctor, it could be a professor, it could be a worker in a factory, it could be a manager or it could be organizations, it could be hospitals, it could be universities, it could be factories. So, any economic agent is going to be called a Decision-Making Unit. That is just the DMU DEA terminologies; DEA is Data Envelopment Analysis. So, yes, as I said earlier, DEA is actually going to measure only the relative efficiency. So, we measure efficiency only in a set of DMU. If the set changes, the efficiency values are likely to change. So, let us understand the logic it is going to build actually an optimization problem for each DMU. So, if there are earlier in the sales example. We had 5 sales officers; we are going to actually formulate 5 optimization problems, one for each sales office, one for each DMU. Solve these optimization problems and look at their objective function value and decide whether this particular DMU is efficient or not efficient. So, let us understand the logic. Let us understand the logic. First of all, let us understand that we are going to consider multiple inputs and multiple outputs. We started doing that from our graphical method, where we had at least more inputs, or we had more outputs. We saw those two examples. So, since we are going to have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, we are going to define instead of a simple ratio of output divided by input; we are going to define what is called weighted ratios? Now, what are weighted ratios? We are going to say that every input has a weight, and every output has a weight. So, why do we want these weights to be added? We want these weights to be added because inputs may not be directly additive. For example, inputs as I said, I invested 1 lakh rupees in my factory, I hired 10 workers. So, I invested 1 lakh rupees, that 1 lakh rupees may have gone in renting the factory, paying the electricity bill or whatever plus I had a workforce of 10 workers. Now, these two are two separate inputs. How do you add up 1 lakh plus 10, 1 lakh rupee invested, 10 workers working, how do you quantify? How do we add up, 1 lakh plus 10 does not make sense? Therefore, we are going to multiply each of the inputs by weight, weight for each input. So, let us say that input 1 plus input 2; now input 1 could be 1 lakh rupees. This is rupees or dollars, and this could be a number of workers. As I said earlier, this may not be directly additive. So, what do I do? I multiply each one of them by their respective weights w1 and w2, and then I say that it is only a weighted input and weighted output. Similarly, I can do that for every output. Now, the output may not always be directly additive. For example, in the previous scenario of comparing sales offices, we said sales achieved and potential leads generated. Those were the two outputs. Now, the sales achieved was in terms of 11 lakhs and 7 lakhs and whatnot, the number of potential leads were 15, 13, 10, you cannot directly add them, obviously, you cannot add them. So, what you are going to do is define output weights and only add up the weighted outputs together. That is the idea. That is the first idea. Since we are going to consider multiple inputs and multiple outputs, you cannot directly add them; you are only going to weight them. So, define weights for each input, define weights for every output, and then take the summation of weighted input, take the summation of weighted output and only then take the ratio. So essentially, this is the weighted input w1 plus w1I1 plus w2I2. We are going to similarly do UiO1 plus U2O2. So, this is the weight for output number 1, this is actually the output number 1, this is the weight for output number 2, this is the actual output number 2, so this is the weighted output, and then the efficiency is going to be weighted in output, which is U1O1 plus U2O2 divided by weighted input, which is w1I1 plus w2I2. So, the ratio is only going to be a weighted ratio. But we do not know these weights. How do you decide? The sales have to be multiplied by U1. That is, the output sales are the output. Now, I have multiplied sales with an output weight of U1; what is the value of U1? I know the value of sales that I have achieved. If I am DMU; If I am a Decision Making Unit, I know how much sales I have generated? I know how many leads I have generated in this particular time period, this particular quarter, I know O2 value; how do you want me to know U2 value, which is the weight for the second output? That is a big question. And the solution to that is we actually do not presume the values of U1 U2; we do not presume the value of w1 w2. Remember w1 w2 are the input weights. U1 U2 are the output weights in this particular scribbling here. We do not know their value of them. We do not presuppose the value of these. We let the optimization engine tell us the optimal weights to be assigned to inputs and outputs. So, we actually let the DMU choose. We let the DMU choose the weights for the input and the weight for the output to the best of their advantage. We let that happen. And we will explain why we let that happen. Let us use cricketing lingo. Everybody understands, hopefully, cricketing example. So, let us say that one particular bowler is pretty good at bowling maidens, made an over pretty good. Now, maiden overs, I do not know probably you will want; you would want to consider them as output maiden overs and output, probably. So, against the number of wickets taken, again, wickets taken is also considered can be considered as output. So, how do you look at the effectiveness or efficiency of a pro bowler? Higher maiden overs that he bowls or she bowls good; more the number of wickets that she takes could. So, in that sense, they are considered output because they are higher the better, more number of maiden overs, better; more number of wickets, better. So, let us say that there is a particular bowler who actually regularly bowls maiden overs but does not go, does not take that many, those many wickets. So, we allow this bowler to assign a higher weight to maiden overs and assign a lower weight to wickets; we let that happen to the best of their advantage. We let the DMU choose the output weights and input weights so that they benefit them. It is okay. We will explain that in a moment. So, we do not presuppose the values of weights. We let the DMU choose, and how does the DMU choose? The DMU chooses through an optimization engine. And what is the objective that the DMU chooses the weights with? What is the logic of choosing the weights? They should choose the input weights and output weights in such a way that their efficiency is maximized. So, it is the maximization of efficiency problem. So, maximize your efficiency; how is efficiency calculated? Efficiency is calculated as a weighted ratio. Now, you choose your output weights carefully. You choose your input weights carefully so that your efficiency is maximized. And we tell every DMU to do this; we tell every DMU. So, for every DMU, the output weight value the input weights value are going to be different. So, this is the optimization problem that we want every DMU to solve. Look at your weights. Choose the weights carefully. So, these are your decision variables. You choose your weights. So, that is the decision that you have to make. What is the weight assigned to output number 1, what is the weight assigned to what is assigned to output number 2, what is the weight assigned to input number 1, what is the weight assigned to input number 3, all that? Choose your weights carefully. That is the decision that you have to make towards what goal. The goal should be to maximize your own efficiency, not somebody else's efficiency; your own efficiency. This is the optimization problem that they should be solving, and they should be solved by every DMU independently of others. What should be the constraint on this optimization problem? We have formulated the objective of this optimization problem. What should be the constraints on this problem? Obviously, in general, it is very common to say that efficiency can only be one or less. The efficiency, in general, cannot be more than 1. So, in general, we are saying that your weights should be such that nobody gets an efficiency of more than 1. Now, if you look at the first example, where we had a single input and a single output, the budget and I think the sales, the quantum of sales, the ratios turned out to be more than 1 if you recall that example. But in defence, we are going to say that those were very plain bear ratios, and those were not weighted ratios. Now, the objective is very different. The objective is to choose the weights carefully. So, we should have chosen the weights carefully there also. So, that the efficiency does not get quoted as more than 1, does not make sense. So, that should be the constraint on this column. Choose your weights to choose your maximize. Choose your weights and maximize your efficiency such that your efficiency cannot be more than 1. So, if you are the most efficient DMU, your efficiency will be equal to 1, and all the inefficient DMUs will report the efficiency of less than 1. So, this should be the constraint. One more twist. Now, not only should this constraint be applicable to this DMU, which is actually solving this problem, this constraint will be applicable to all the DMUs. What do I mean? Let us say that sales office 1, sales office 1 is solving the optimization problem, where it is trying to choose the weights carefully so that it maximizes its own efficiency. Let us say that it is doing that. Now, using the weights of sales office 1, using the weights of sales office 1, the other sales officers should not report an efficiency of more than 1 because whatever happens, efficiency cannot be more than 1. So, let me say that constraint again. Not only should your efficiency be less than 1, but the weight should also be chosen carefully such that the efficiency is maximized. But the efficiency value reported cannot be more than 1, not only for you, but using your weights using the weights of sales office 1, the other sales offices also should not report an efficiency of more than 1. That is the constraint that we are going to add to our optimization problem. So, what are the constraints? Choose the weights, such that using these weights, none of the DMUs, including yourself, none of the DMUs should get an efficiency of more than 1. That is the constraint. That is the optimization problem right here. Now, you have defined the object. You have an optimization problem, you have defined the constraints, you have defined the decision variables, those are the three important components of an optimization problem, and you have defined all three of them. Going further. Obviously, every DMU has a right to choose their own input and output weights. Now, if using my own input weights and my own output weights, if I cannot raise the efficiency of 1, that really means that I am not efficient. Let me repeat that argument. If I am given the freedom to choose any input weight and any output weight, I have the freedom to choose my own input weights and my own output weights. Using my own input weights and my own output weights, if I cannot tell you that my efficiency is 1 that really means I am not efficient, clearly. However, using your weights, using your input weights, and your output weights, if some other DMU gets an efficiency of 1, they, here you are not even giving them the freedom to choose their weights. They are taking your weights, they are taking your input weights, and they are taking your output weights. Even with your input weights and your output weights, if they get an efficiency of 1 clearly, they are so much better clearly; they are good. So, then that particular other DMU look at the scenario, using your input weights and your output weights, they can still quote an efficiency of 1 if they were given the freedom to choose input and output weights, they would have definitely done the same, they would have turned out to be efficient ones. So, whatever we, you said they are good; the other DMU is efficient DMU. And always remember that we are referring to only relative efficiency. So, the efficiency numbers depend only on the set of sales offices that you have considered in the analysis. Alright, is the logic clear? Can we move to the actual formulation of the optimization problem? Here I must refer you to an earlier session done by Doctor Srivatsa, where he had given the preliminary basics of operations research and formulation of optimization problem; the linear problem. Here also the objective is the same. We are hoping that our optimization problem turns out to be a linear optimization problem. So, if you are ready, we can get into the formulation of the optimization problem. If you want to pause here and go back and refer to those sessions by Doctor Srivatsa, where he explains operations research, feel free to do that. But, let us proceed with the mathematical formulation of our optimization problem. Now, towards that, let us define the notations. Let us say that the number of DMUs considered in this data set be K, capital K. So, in the examples that we have looked at so far, we had 5 sales offices. So, here K was 5. For example, our capital K was 5. The number of inputs considered is capital N, number of outputs considered is capital M. So, far, we have looked at our two-input example. So, capital N was 2. We have looked at two output examples. So, capital M was 2. So, that is what we are saying. Now, this Iik capital I subscript ik is the notation that is going to be used for the value of input I for a DMU K. Let me take you to an example. So, this was an input, this was input number 1, this was input number 2. Now, input number 1 has a value of 3,00,000 for sales office 1. So, input number 1 for sales office 1 is equal to 3,00,000, input number 1 for sales office 2 has a value of 2,56,000, input number 2 for sales office 1 has a value of 13, input number 2, sales office 4 has a value of 10, you get the idea. Similarly, sales were an output number; leads were also an output. So O1 is the output number 1, which is sales, O2 is the output number 2, which is the number of leads. So, O11 output number 1 for sales office number 1 is 11,10,000. Output number 1 for sales office 5 is 24,00,000. Output number 2, for sales office 3 has a value of 12; that is what the notation means. That is what the notation means. So, that is how you define Iik and Ojk. It is the value of output j for a DLU K, for a DMU K where j goes from 1 to M because there are m outputs and K goes from 1 to k because there are k DMUs considered in our dataset. Now, simply considering the input values and the output values is not sufficient. Earlier we have defined that these should be weighted inputs and weighted outputs. So, let us define the weights Xik and Yjk other weights; Xik is a weight assigned to input I by DMU k. Go back, here. So, here this is the input 1 input 2. For this input, let us consider sales office 1 now sales office 1 is going to assign a weight of X11, what does this mean? The weight assigned to input number 1 by sales office number 1, this will be X1, X21, this will be X21, input number 1 DMU number 1, this is still sales office number 1, this is still sales office number 1. What will this is? What is this? This is the weight assigned by sales office 4 to input number 2. So, this will be 2; input number 2 assigned by sales office number 4. So, this is XiK, K is the DMU, i is the number of inputs, the input subscript. Similarly, Yjk, Yjk very similar, that is, the weight assigned to outputs by that particular DMU. So, of sales office 3, this is output number 1; output number 1 is sales. So, for sales, DMU 3 says that Y13, input number 1 sales office 3 is assigning the weight; therefore, this weight is going to be w1 not Y13. And finally, the efficiency of a DMU k is going to be denoted by 1, the efficiency of the kth DMU. So, those are the notations. Now, what is this optimization problem? What is this optimization problem? The optimization problem is maximize the efficiency by carefully choosing the weights. This line here. How do you write this statement mathematically? So, having explained the notations on the previous slide and the objective of the optimization problem, now the goal is to formulate the problem mathematically. How do we formulate the optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the efficiency by choosing the correct set of weights. So, first of all, let us start by defining efficiency. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of weighted output to the weighted input. It is the ratio of the weighted output to the weighted input; output divided by input was the definition. Now, we are just going to assign weights, and it is going to be a summation of output weights in the numerator summation of weighted inputs in the denominator, summation of weighted output in the numerator summation of weighted input in the denominator. Summation of weighted output in the numerator summation of weighted input in the denominator. So, and the weights are essentially decided by the DMU, they choose their own weights so that their efficiency is maximized. So, how do you write the expression for weighted output? You write that for a particular DMU k, the weighted output and the weighted inputs are given by this. So, essentially O1k is the first output for DMU k, O2k is the second output for DMU k, O3k is the third output for DMU k, Omk is the Mth output for DMU. If you remember, we had M outputs. So, and then the DMU assigns weights to the output. So, y1k is the weight for the first output. y2k is the weight for the second output, ymk is the weight for the Mth output. This is the numerator. This is the weighted output. Now, the weighted input, which is the denominator. So, I1k I2k I3k are the inputs input number 1, input number 2, input number 3 for the kth new DMU; we are considering kth DMU because that is the example here we are looking at the efficiency of the kth DMU. And the weights X1k is the weight for the first input assigned by DMU k, X2k is the input for the second weight assigned by DMU k there are n such inputs. So, Ink will be the value of the nth input for DMU k. xnk will be the weight assigned to the nth input by DMU k; that is how you define the efficiency as the ratio of weighted output to the weighted input. The optimization problem is to maximize my own efficiency, their own efficiency by adjusting the weights assigned for inputs and outputs. So, how do you write that mathematically and obviously, the constraint that using my weights nobody else, no, none of the DMUs should get an efficiency of more than 1. Therefore, the way we write the optimization problem is the objective function which maximizes Ek that is what every DMU is interested in, not to maximize everybody else's efficiency. Remember, this is DMU k solving the problem. So, what is the objective for DMU k? Maximize my own efficiency, maximize their own efficiency they are not interested this is not social good. I am trying to maximize my own efficiency. What are the constraints? Using my weights, none of the DMU should get an efficiency of more than 1. So, how do you write that constraint mathematically? You say that efficiency value for every DMU; efficiency value for DMU number 1, efficiency value for DMU number 2, efficiency value for DMU number 3, efficiency value for DMU number k where this DMU will also be there. Everybody should get an efficiency of less than or equal to 1 that is the constraint. So, those are the constraints. How many will such constraints be there? There will be K such constraints- capital K such constraints. If you have 5 sales offices in your dataset, you are going to get 5 such constraints for every DMU trying to solve this problem. Every DMU will say that well using my weights, none of the DMUs, including myself, should get an efficiency of more than 1. What are the decision variables here? The decision variables are the x and y's, which are the input weights and the output weights. Now, this is not, so what is this notation is for all i, for all j; this is the notation this is called for all, so this for all i, this is for all j's. Now, I have not written for all cases. Why is that? Why is that not included here? Because when the DMU k solves this optimization problem, it does not optimally decide the weight forever. It says these are the ways that I am going to use. So, it does not choose weights for everybody. It chooses weights only for itself. So, you do not actually need for all k. Therefore, it is not included. Here that again, here that again, every DMU is interested in only choosing the weights for itself. It is not enforcing these weights on everybody else. Therefore, the decision variables are not weights for everybody else. Decision variables are what weights, what input weights and what output weights should I be using so that my efficiency gets maximized, but none of the efficiency values are more than 1. That is the optimization problem. I hope the optimization problem is now clear to you. Now, what are the complexities? What are the complexities of this optimization problem? Did you know? Did you notice this optimization problem carefully? What is the objective function? The objective function is Ek now; what is Ek? Where is my Ek? This is my Ek. What are my decision variables? My decision variables are x and y's. Now, recall the operations research session that you had earlier. Here the decision variables are represented as ratios, y y1k, y2k y3k, and denominator as x1k, x2k, x3k, and so on. So, what we have is a scenario where the objective function is a ratio of decision variables. What are the constraints? Constraints are Ek less than 1, Ek less than or equal to 1. Once again, your constraints are ratios of decision variable constraints are ratios of decision variables. So, this optimization problem is going to be not an easy problem to solve because we have the objective function as well as constraints, which are not linear functions of the decision variable. So, both the objective function as well as constraints are ratios of decision variables. Since they are ratios, they are essentially nonlinear formulations. The objective function is a nonlinear function of the decision variables because it is a ratio. Constraints are also nonlinear functions of the decision variables because they are also ratios. So, what we have is a nonlinear optimization problem. You never had a primer on nonlinear optimization. You only have understood how to solve a linear optimization problem. So, let us do the next logical step. What is that step? Let us linearize the problem. Let us make this nonlinear optimization problem a linear optimization problem. Why, of course, because a linear optimization problem is an easier problem to solve is so much easier. Nonlinear optimization problems have all kinds of complexities. Let us do away with that. Let us linearize the problem without losing the essence of the problem. Essence is the following. We are still in the business of maximizing the efficiency of a particular DMU. We are still saying that the DMU should choose the weights so that the efficiency values do not go beyond 1 for anybody. That is the essence. We will not lose the essence but still try to linearize the problem. How do you do that? What do we do is linearize. Instead of maximizing the entire efficiency value, which is the ratio of output divided by input, we will only maximize the numerator. Anyway, you know, if you maximize the numerator your Ek value will get, you will get a higher Ek value will get higher. So, we select you to choose to maximize the numerator and then normalizing the denominator. How to linearize this problem we linearize this problem by maximizing the numerator in that efficiency equation and normalizing the denominator to 1. Now, the denominator is 1; therefore, actually, there is no fraction efficiencies divided by weighted output divided by weighted input. Now, you are maximizing the weighted output, and you are saying weighted input is actually equal to 1. So, therefore there is no denominator so, you are simply maximizing the numerator and the constraints to linearize the constraint. We rearrange the constraints in such a way that they become linear. They appear to be linear. So, essentially, we are saying that the numerator divided by denominator has to be less than or equal to 1. And then, we say that this is nonlinear because it is a ratio. So, what we will do is we will rewrite the constraints such that we say that numerator is less than or equal to the denominator. The numerator is a linear function of weights; the denominator is a linear function of weights. So, now this constraint has become a linear function of the input weights and output weights. Here, the way the constraint was written it appeared that it is a nonlinear function of decision variables. Here, it has been converted to a linear function of decision variables. What is the resultant optimization problem as a result of an optimization problem is a linear problem for a particular DMU. First of all, we are going to say that the objective function is only the maximization of the weighted output. We are not saying weighted efficiency; we are only saying weighted output because that is the numerator. So, essentially this is output number 1 for DMU k. This is awkward number 2 for DMU k. This is output number 3 for DMU k. This is output number M for DMU k. These are the weights assigned to outputs by DMU k. So, that is your objective function. How do you normalize the denominator? You normalize the denominator by saying that that is your first constraint. So, the first constraint is an equality constraint where you are normalizing the input to 1, the weighted input to 1, so this is input number 1 for DMU k, this is input number 2 for DMU k, this is input number n for DMU k. These are the weights assigned by DMU k to various inputs. Now, you notice how does this constant is going to play. The input values I1, I2, I3 In for this particular DMU. They cannot be changed. Recall what were the input values? Input values were the budget; input values were the team sizes. Now, those values cannot be rescaled. The only thing that this constraint is going to do is- it is going to assign the weights in such a way that this normalized equation is 1, the weighted input is 1. The last thing to be done in this normalization step is to write the constraint carefully. Our earlier constraint was equal less than or equal to 1, which we said is a ratio of the numerator divided by denominator, and therefore it is a nonlinear term. So, let us rearrange this. We will say that nor our numerator is less than or equal to the denominator. And what is a numerator? The numerator is the weighted output, and the denominator is the weighted input. And if we write it in this way, it is a ratio and therefore nonlinear. If you write it in this way, it becomes a linear function of the output weights and the input weights. So, let us write that. So, however, this should be applicable to all cases, using my weights, the DMU k, DMU k is saying what? Using my weights, nobody should get an efficiency of more than 1, including me. So, for DMU number 1, so this is k equal to 1. This is DMU number 1. DMU number 1 is saying how do I calculate my efficiency using DMU ks', which DMU k is going to use the weight y1k, y2k, ymk input weights will be x1k, x2k, xnk. These are the weights used by DMU k. Now DMU 1 should get an efficiency of less than or equal to 1 using the weights used by DMU k. So, the output values are corresponding to DMU number 1, I11, I21, IN1. Those are the inputs for DMU 1, inputs for DMU 1, but the weights are essentially taken from the weights used by DMU k. That is what we mean by using the weights that DMU k is using. No other DMU should get an efficiency of more than 1. So, this is a constraint for the first DMU trying to use the weights for DMU k and getting an efficiency of less than or equal to 1. Similarly, DMU number 2 outputs are O12, O22, OM2. Inputs are I12, I22, IN2. These are the inputs for DMU number 2. They are still using the weights for DMU k still using the weights for DMU k. So, the weights have not changed. It is still y1k, y1k, y2k, y2k. x3k, x3k somewhere here. So, using the weights for DMU k, DMU number 2 should not get an efficiency of more than 1. Similarly, you write the constraint for DMU number 3, DMU number 4, DMU number 5 all the way to the last DMU, which is the capital K DMU capital K. So, the output is O1K, O2K capital K OMK X INK I2K those are the input values. The weights, however, are still the same wage. They are the same way it is used by DMU k. So, this is the DM. This is the problem that DMU k is solving, obviously. The decision variables are the x and y weights used by this DMU. So, Xik and Yjk here is a DMU k is solving this problem. Similarly, there will be an optimization problem for each DMU. So, this is how you formulate an optimization problem for data envelopment analysis, and we have spent time explaining the logic. And we have spent time explaining the mathematics and for finally linearizing the objective linearizing the optimization problem so that it is an easier problem to solve. It looks a little abstract. The way the slide is all mathematical notations, but in the next session, we will actually use one of our examples and write this optimization problem in numerical terms. So, capital IIK and capital OJK will get values based on the example that we have used. So, let us end the session here and go to the next session with examples.
