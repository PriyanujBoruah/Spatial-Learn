Good morning everyone, welcome to this new session on efficiency. Now, the moment at least the engineers amongst us look at efficiency they say I know about this, for example, they would say a motor is supposed to have a rated output of 110-megawatt kilowatt and it is only giving me 100 megawatt. So, probably the motor is running at an efficiency of 100 divided by 110. Some would argue that no no no, this is not the way efficiency is calculated efficiency is how efficiently how do you convert input to output. So, it is not rated output against the actual output, some people would argue that it is actually the ratio of how much output do you get per unit of input that you have given. So, what is all? What is all this? And how does it matter to a business? How does it matter to a decision making unit? That is what we are going to look at in these series of lectures. So, even before we get started, let me clarify, let me clarify that we may be looking at efficiency as rated the actual output divided by rated output and or as we said, some people will say it is output divided by the input. So, let me clarify right away that we are actually going with this definition rather than this definition. So, it is output divided by input that is the way we are going to proceed. And we are going to focus only on economic efficiency. So, let us let us quickly understand, what context are we talking about. So, what does economics teaches, economics essentially is a science of if it teaches us effective utilisation of the resources, so that we can get maximum benefit out of utilisation of these resources. So, that is the core, I mean, we can argue that economics actually I agree that it is a very, very rich science, but this is one of the most important thing that economics hopefully helps us understand, within the economic ideas, there is something called productive efficiency. Now, what is this productive efficiency? Productive efficiency is that aspect of efficiency which focuses on maximising the output under given set of constraints that you operate under. So, when we calculate this productive efficiency, we usually don't worry about, are we allocating the resources correctly? Do we, we will not worry about whether we are in the correct market, whether we are manufacturing the correct set of products. Let us, not worry about that. Once all those decisions have been made, how do you maximise output given the conditions that we operate under? Now, obviously, technology is going to play an important role and we are a throughout these calculations. So, we are going to assume that the technology actually doesn't change. So, economic idea essentially talk about something called an efficiency frontier efficiency envelope. So, what is this efficiency envelope or efficiency frontier essentially, if a economic unit is on that efficiency frontier, then we have a combination of output such that you cannot increase output of one aspect without affecting the output of the other aspect, of course, this is without any change of technology. So, let me say that again, what is the frontier then? Frontier is that optimal combination of outputs, optimal combination of output such that you cannot increase output number one without affecting the output number two. So, that is what we mean by frontier and throughout the sessions, we are going to chase this very elusive idea of efficiency frontier. So, and obviously the organizations or economic units that find themselves on the frontier, they are going to be called as efficient organisations or efficient economic units and the organisations that unfortunately are not on this frontier, they are going to be classified as inefficient economic units or inefficient organisations. So, let us quickly understand as I had earlier described, let us quickly understand how are we going to measure this efficiency. So, as I said earlier in the simplest possible way efficiency is going to be defined as a ratio of output to input. So, a very simple diagrammatic representation would be something like this, you input something into a process the production, it could be a production process, it could be service process it could be anything. Right? And you get certain output, we are actually not going to worry too much about what happens here that let that be a black box, we will only worry about how much input goes in and how much output comes out of this blank box. As we said earlier, we are not going to worry about what happens here, what technologies are used. So, that's not the focus of the discussion here. So yeah, if we say that efficiency is the ratio of output versus input, very simple, then what is the complication? Why do we need a separate session on this? Why is it so complex to calculate efficiency to measure efficiency to compare one economic unit, saying that this economic unit has a higher efficiency than some other economic unit. So, why is it so complex? Why do you think it is complex? Well, of course, yes, it is complex because any economic unit any organisation in reality does not have a single input, it always has a combination of inputs. So, the input could be in terms of labour. The labour itself could be classified in various skills, various expertise, various locations, infrastructure, by infrastructure we could mean the buildings and the land and the machinery that all that is used essentially as an input to a production process, financial assets, financial inputs like money. Whether that money comes from financial assets, whether that comes from loan. So, essentially everything that goes as an input that as an investment into a production process is your resources they are called resources, very simple, in other economic courses, you would have understand, you would have discussed the three M's, the man, machine and money. So, man is essentially labour, machine is essentially all the infrastructure and money is money. So, though three important resources and there may be many more within these three or there may be many more outside of these three also. So, essentially we generally do not deal with single input, very similarly on the other hand, we do not deal with single output. Now, output of a economic unit could be measured in various ways, output could be number of customers served, output could be number of customers that you have acquired in this particular time period, we could be looking at profit, we could be looking at sales volume, we could be looking at revenue. It could be for a hospital, it could be the number of days, number of days it took the patient to recover that could be one of the outputs. Any kind of benefit that comes out of this economic unit is then output. So, essentially output tells us how has the organisation performed, how has the organisation faired on that particular dimension that is essentially the output. And that is why calculating efficiency is actually difficult. Because we have multiple inputs, we have multiple outputs. Even if we say simple ratio of output versus input, it does get complicated. Why should it get complicated? If you look at some of the common measures of quantifying efficiency, various industries have various parameters. Let us, take retail industry. Let us, take a mall. Now, how do you measure output of a mall? A most commonly used measure of understanding how the mall has performed let us say there are two malls in a particular city, we want to understand which mall has done better. A typical way to measure quote, unquote efficiency of a mall is sales per square feet. So, mall has certain square foot of retail area, those are rented out to various brands, various organisations, and they have certain sales in a particular month, in a particular week, in a particular year and a typical way to measure the effectiveness of a mall or efficiency of a mall is to say what is the sales per square feet. Right now, do you think not right now but pre-pandemic, what do you think India's malls were doing in terms of that particular parameter sales per square feet? Pre-pandemic statistics essentially told us that most of the malls were not doing that well on this parameter. So, if we say efficiency of a mall is measured only in terms of sales per square feet, we would have concluded, they are not doing that great. Look at the other measure of understanding how the mall works. Now, if we would have taken a different measure, let us say number of customers per week, number of customers per week, Right?. One of the ways that mall can serve a community is hopefully to attract a lot of customers and they get what they want. If you look at all the statistics, we have in India's mall, we as in India's malls have been doing extremely well on attracting the customers to the mall. The problem has always been converting these visits to actual sales. So, the point that I am trying to make is we have various inputs and various outputs, if you selectively pick some inputs and outputs and you define the efficiency of an economic unit, you will end up concluding that the economic unit is doing well or not doing doing well. But we can't look at this selective picking of input and output what we are trying to understand in this session is a comprehensive measure of efficiency. So, there are various things, various things that we will have to look at. What are the things that we are going to focus on? What are we what are the things we are going to focus on in this session? The questions that we are trying to answer in this session are, how does this input and output work when we have several inputs and several outputs? That is what I have been talking about retail industry. Now, then if we have this several inputs, several outputs scenario. How do you calculate productive efficiency of an economic unit? Once again, let me clarify, by economic unit I am going to this term economic unit is going to be used very generically and by this economic unit, we are going to say that anything, it may be factory, it may be a hospital or it may be a university, it may be a person. Any agent that is involved in economic activity, we are going to call them as economic unit. So, we are trying to understand in this session how to calculate productive efficiency of an economic unit in presence of several inputs and several outputs. Hopefully, next thing we are going to discuss is, how do we compare, the measure that we are hopefully going to design should be should help us in comparing several economic units in terms of their efficiency. Right? And lastly, we will try to answer that question we are going to come up with this measure and calculate the efficiency of every economic unit and then going to say these economic units are efficient these economic units are not so efficient. Now, how does that help an inefficient unit? We have to tell the inefficient unit what should they do, so that they are also called efficient economic units. Right? So, if we find out that a particular economic unit is inefficient, how can they become efficient? What should they do? Should they reduce the input should they increase the output. What exactly is our prescription to these inefficient units? So, that they also get into the efficient set of economic units? Right? So, these are the questions that we are going to answer. As I said, most of the times the common approaches do not work because common approaches to calculating and comparing efficiencies are focused on selective choices of inputs and outputs. Some of the commonly used approaches particularly in operations, operating ratios as labour costs per transaction. Once again labour costs per transactions. So, you are only going to look at labour cost, right, and then you going to say this economic unit is better in terms of labour costs, but remember, it is still labour costs only one of the outputs considered. For example, one of my colleagues at IIT Madras has done extensive research on comparing the efficiency of cricket players. Now, for cricket player runs per innings, generally called the average, average of a player tells us how good the player is, but it will it tells us only one aspect of the player and therefore, even when the cricket match is going on you often see on the screen several statistics quoted in addition to the average, particularly if you are talking about T20s it is very common practice now, to quote the strike rate. Now, what is the strike rate? Strike rate is the number of run scored per 100 balls. That is also selectively picking one input and one output. Number of runs scored is output and 100 balls is the input. If one player is doing pretty well on strike rate that doesn't mean that the same player is doing pretty well on runs per innings. So, problem with these very localised ratios or operating ratios is it does not consider the entire mix of inputs and outputs, which is very common in a realistic setting. Now, the other common approach is to define what are called as financial ratios. For example, price to earnings ratio or debt to equity ratio or EPS earnings per share, right, very commonly used, very commonly used to say that this organisation is doing well this organisation is not doing so well, many of the investment decisions are made looking at these ratios, PE ratio is important, EPS is important. Right? The problem with this kind of approach is that we are assuming that everything can be converted to a dollar.Right? Everything can be converted in monetary basis. In some situations that may or may not hold. Right? So, for the problems with this approach is that nothing, not everything can be converted in terms of currency basis. Right? Secondly, these many other financial ratios not these in particular, but many of the financial ratios essentially talk about profitability of an organisation. What we are currently dealing with is actually efficiency of a organisation and remember not any efficiency, we earlier decided that we are going to focus on productive efficiency.Right? The operating efficiency of an organisation. So, we have to make the differentiation that if you convert everything in terms of dollar terms, are we looking at profitability, whereas we should be looking at operating efficiency. So, that's the context. We are going to look at productive efficiency, we are going to look at a diverse combination of inputs and outputs and our focus is not only to calculate productive efficiency, but actually compare organisations on the basis of this productive efficiency. Hopefully, we should, at the by the end of the sessions, we should have some prescriptions for the inefficient unit as to what they should do, if they wish to become efficient or if they wish to be called as efficient units. So, let us end the session here and continue with this in the next one.
